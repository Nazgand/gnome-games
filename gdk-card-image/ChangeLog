2003-12-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Removed the dependence on an internal
	knowledge of GamesFileList.

2003-11-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Moved the games_get_file_list code out to a library.

2003-11-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Removed some unnecessary code and fixed a bug
	where the first selection would fail if the default style was the
	current style when the preferences were opened.

2003-11-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c (gtk_card_deck_options_edit_set): Get _edit_set
	to find the a matching style, if any. Also make the selection
	finally work properly and not reset the moment the dialog is
	opened.

2003-11-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-iamge.c (gdk_card_deck_options_edit_get_card_styles):
	* card-style-file.h:	
	* card-style-file.c (card_style_compare): Sort the style list and
	add an API call to card-style to assist this.

	* card-styles.xml: Added more styles.

	* gdk-card-image.c (gtk_card_deck_options_edit_create_list): And
	another Heisenbug fixed. Make sure gtk_list_store gets the correct
	type to store.

	* card-style-file.h (NUM_COMPONENTS): Heisenbug! I wish I had read
	my own comment.

2003-11-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Rearranged to put all the
	gtk_card_deck_options_edit stuff together.

2003-11-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* card-style-file.c:
	* card-style-file.h:	
	* gdk-card-image.c: Start cleaning up my code from last night. The
	definition and parsing of card style files has been moved into
	it's own file and is free of nasty global variables and might even
	be thread safe.

2003-11-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: The rough cut of the new card style selection
	widget. Known to work for aisleriot and should work for blackjack,
	but is inherently broken (it uses globals to store the state of
	the object). Good proof-of-principle though.

	* Makefile.am: 
	* card-styles.xml: Created and added to the distribution.

2003-10-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c (gdk_card_deck_new): Applied a patch from Mark
	Schreiber to catch the case where the card images are missing.

2003-07-26  Steve Chaplin

	* Makefile.am: Remove trailing '/' on directories so we install to 
	<dir>/<file> rather than <dir>//<file>. Automake already knows we need 
	a '/' between the directory and filename.

2003-06-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Compile warning cleanups and deprecated
	function removal.

2003-06-17  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gdk-card-image.c (gdk_card_deck_dir_search): Use
	g_build_filename to construct paths.

2003-06-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.h: 
	* gdk-card-image.c:
	I have made gdk_card_deck_options_edit a proper GTK widget (and it
	is now called gtk_card_deck_options_edit) without the dependence
	on having a notebook to fit into. Also used 2.0 API rather than
	the 1.x one. I have also removed the "dirty" call since it was in
	the way and we should be responding to the "changed" signal
	anyway.
	
2003-06-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (cardback_DATA): Added new pixmaps, including the
	spectacular Dondorf set. Originally from the PySol program.

2003-05-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Trying to solve multi-platform build problems
	by using generic glib functions (and thereby making it glib's
	problem to try and figure out whether to include dirent.h or
	not). This should fix bug #111225 and several others.

2003-05-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Added a generic card game icon (it had been floating
	around the gnome-desktop module and needed a new home).

2003-05-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.h: Added C++ guards so that C++ code can use
	it. Do I have something in mind ? No of course not, there is no
	blackjack game that needs C++ support.

2003-05-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Hopefully the ifdefs are a bit more friendly
	to NetBSD and don't break anything else. Hopefully resolves bug
	#111225.

2003-04-06  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Don't use #elif for Sun. Thanks to Rick
	Burridge, closing #109988.

2003-02-24  Theo van Klaveren  <t.vanklaveren@student.utwente.nl>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Include <sys/types.h> if it is present.
	Conditionally include <dirent.h> on FreeBSD. Kludgey, but I can't
	think of any other way. Fixes compile on FreeBSD. Closes #106963.

2002-07-04  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Bad hacky mojo to fix building on OSF/1
	(closes #77903).

2002-06-05  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gdk-card-image.c: (gdk_card_deck_dir_search),
	(gdk_card_deck_file_load): make sure it works if freecell isn't
	installed in the libgnome prefix

2002-04-16  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gdk-card-image.c: (is_image): revert previous change about gnome-vfs
	and include gnome-vfs-mime.h header

2002-04-16  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gdk-card-image.c: (gdk_card_deck_get_type), (is_image):
	* gdk-card-image.h: fix headers and use proper gnome-vfs function,
	use a GtkType instead of a guint for gdk_card_get_type
	(Closes: #77902)

2001-12-16  Juan Pablo Mendoza <jpablo@gnome.org>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Fix bad formated comment.

2001-07-07  Juan Pablo Mendoza <pablo_juan@yahoo.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Killed Imlib.

Tue Feb 06 16:51:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Deal with errors and missing files/directories
	  correctly.  Use gnome-mime instead of g_is_image_filename to
	  avoid warning.

1999-02-20  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am (cardbackdir): limited the number of cards available
	for small and medium suit vals.
	* gdk-card-image.c: as above.
	(make_suit): remove small image from joker -- just 2 black jokers
	and 2 red jokers instead.

1998-12-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gdk-card-image.c (gdk_imlib_rotate_image_180): Small fix to the
	new imlib api.  This should not be poking with Imlib internals in
	the first place.

Sat Nov 21 Felix Bellaby <felix@pooh.u-net.com>
	* gdk-card-image.h: Redsigned to use gdk objects, now offers a
 	gtknotebook page for selecting card preferences.
	* gdk-card-image.c: Substantially rewritten.
	* Makefile.am: updated for new image arrangement.
	* *.png: png based images to replace xpm.
	
Mon Oct 26 Felix Bellaby <felix@pooh.u-net.com>
	* gdk-card-image.h (gdk_card_image_unref): frees X server refs.
	* gdk-card-image.h (gdk_card_image_back): returns a card back image.
	* gdk-card-image.h (gdk_card_image_{face/mask}): simpler, quicker API.
	* gdk-card-image.c: Brought geometry of images closer to "real" cards. 
	Switched to using imlib. Doubled the corner symbols.
	* Cardback{1-5}.xpm: Added masks to card back xpms.
	* Suits.xpm, Pictures.xpm: New xpms for the cards
	* Suits.xpat.xpm, Pictures.xpat.xpm: Reformated versions of old xpms.
