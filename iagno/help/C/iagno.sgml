 <title>Introduction</title>
 <sect2 id="what">
  <title>What is Iagno?</title>
  
  <para>
  <application>Iagno</application> is a computer version of 
  the game Reversi, more popularly called Othello.  
  <application>Iagno</application> is a two player strategy 
  game similar to Go.  The board is 8 by 8 with chips that 
  are black on one side and white on the other side.  The 
  object of <application>Iagno</application> is to flip as 
  many of your opponent's chips to your color as possible 
  without your opponent flipping your chips.  This is done 
  by trapping your opponent's chips between two chips of 
  your own color.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="why">
  <title>Why is Othello called Iagno? 
  <para>
  You're probably wondering why is this computer game called 
  <application>Iagno</application> instead of Othello or 
  even gnothello.  The answer is simple; the author named 
  it that way and it's his application.  Instead of leaving 
  it at that, I'll tell you a long and complicated lie about 
  the origin of the name <application>Iagno</application>.
  </para>
  <para>
  On a stormy night, like those depicted so much in England, 
  a lonely programmer was sitting in front of his computer 
  screen.  Ian had finished his masterpiece in gaming.  It 
  was a fully interactive game of Othello and he decided
  to play a pun with the name and called it gnothello for 
  the game was written using Gnome.  
  </para>
  <para>
  Later his buddies came over and like all programmers he 
  showed off his masterpiece.  They all laugh in his face 
  and tell Ian that his game is worthless and a pitiful 
  attempt to be a true hacker.  After Ian kicks them out 
  he decides to rename his program Iago 
  <footnote>
   <para>
   Iago is Othello's nemesis in the play <citetitle>Othello
   </citetitle> by William Shakespeare.
   </para>
  </footnote>
  for the evil which 
  has manifested itself due to his game.  Yet it still 
  doesn't sound right.  All Gnome programs have some part 
  of Gnome in it Ian thought.  After much thought he decides 
  on the name we have come to cherish, <application>Iagno
  </application>.
  </para>

 <para>
 The board starts with four chips arranged in a box on the 
 middle of the board. The chips have the same color at each 
 corner, as shown in <xref linkend="start-shot">.

 <para>
 Black goes first and places a chip on the board such that it 
 traps white's chips between two of black's chips. When black places 
 a chip on the board all of white's chips, between black's newly placed 
 chip and another black chip, in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, are flipped over 
 and become black, as shown in <xref linkend="first-shot">.

 <para>
 When there is chip trapped between two chips, of an identical color 
 in the same row, the player captures chips until another chip of the 
 player's color is encountered, as shown in <xref linkend="block-shot">.  
 The player can only take chips that are 
 a direct result of the placing a chip on the board. Once a chip is 
 placed on the board the player cannot remove it and place the chip 
 somewhere else. If a player cannot move they forfeit their turn.  
 The game ends when it is no longer possible for either player to move.

  <title>Choosing A Color</title>
 
  <para>
  When you start Iagno the human player plays black and the computer player 
  plays white with the first level of difficulty. You can change either the 
  color the you play or the level of difficulty in the <guimenu>Settings 
  </guimenu> menu. Go to <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu> and in the 
  <guimenuitem>Players</guimenuitem> tab pick the color you want and 
  the difficulty level of the computer player.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="quick-moves">
  <title>Quick Moves Option</title>

  <para>
  This option is in the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu. Then go to the 
  <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu> submenu in the <guimenuitem>Players
  </guimenuitem> tab and it is initially off. When enabled this option 
  makes the computer player place its chips faster. 
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Note:</title>
   <para>
   Enabling this option does not force the computer player to move and does 
   not reduce the level of difficulty.
   </para>

 <title>Animations</title>

 <para>
 All the animation option are in the 
 <menuchoice>
  <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
  <guisubmenu>Preferences </guisubmenu>
 </menuchoice>
 menus with the <guimenuitem>Animations</guimenuitem> tab highlighted.
 </para>

 <sect2 id="animation-amount">
  <title>Amount of Animation</title>

  <para>
  This option controls the amount of animation present when each chip is 
  flipped using radio buttons.  Selecting the option <guibutton>none
  </guibutton> will cause the chips to change color instantaneously.  
  Selecting the <guibutton>option</guibutton> partial will cause the 
  animation to flip the chips slowly.  Selecting the <guibutton>complete
  </guibutton> option will cause the chips to flip slowly and smoothly.
  </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="stagger-flips">
  <title>Stagger Flips</title>
  
  <para>
  This option will make the chip flip halfway and then back to its 
  original color if the chip is captured in two consecutive moves.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Tip:</title>
   <para>
   This option works best when the <guibutton>quick moves</guibutton> 
   option is also selected.  If the <guibutton>quick</guibutton> moves 
   option is not selected this option will have no visible effect on 
   flipping the chips.
   </para>
  </tip>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="grid">
  <title>Show Grid</title>

  <para>
  This option will display a grid on top of the playing surface.  The 
  grid is useful to display because it shows the player exactly where 
  they are placing each chip.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Tip:</title>
   <para>
   This option should be enabled for beginning players to see the gameplay 
   more clearly.
   </para>
  </tip>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="flip-final">
  <title>Flip Final Results</title>

  <para>
  This option moves all the black chips to the top of the board and all the 
  white chips to the bottom of the board at the end of the game.  This allows 
  you to visually see the outcome of the game.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Note:</title>
   <para>
   This option does not affect the outcome of the game in any way.
   </para>

 <sect2 id="tile-set">
  <title>Tile Set</title>
  <para>
  This option lets you choose the type of board and chips which are displayed.  
  If you want to make your own tile sets use the classic tile set as a template 
  and change the texture and colors for different effects.  When you make a new 
  tile set that works with Iagno send to it Ian Peters <email>itp@gnu.org</email> 
  and he will include into the next distribution.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Important:</title>
   <para>
   There are three tile sets which look the same.  Please do not report this as 
   a bug or you will be promptly ignored.
