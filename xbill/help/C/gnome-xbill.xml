	Yet again, the fate of the world rests in your hands! An evil computer
	hacker, known only by his handle <quote>Bill</quote>, has created the ultimate
	computer virus.  A virus so powerful that it has the power to transmute
	an ordinary computer into a toaster oven.  (oooh!) <quote>Bill</quote>
	has cloned 
	himself into a billion-jillion micro-Bills. Their sole purpose is to 
	deliver the nefarious virus, which has been cleverly disguised as a
	popular operating system.
