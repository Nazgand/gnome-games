			Ten piles.  Four piles (piles 1, 4, 7, and 10) get dealt 5
			cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards
			down and one card up.  Cards can be built down regardless of suit.
			Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit.  Empty piles
			can be filled with any card or movable unit.

	<sect2>Goal</sect2>
	<para>
		To have eight sequences of cards (four for each suit) going down from King
		down to Ace in the foundation.
	</para>

	<sect2>Rules</sect2>
	<para>
		Build down regardless of suit.  Sequences of cards in the same suit can
		be moved as a unit.  Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal
		sequence.
	</para>
	<para>
		Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
		pile.  However, all piles must be non-empty.  If an empty pile exists,
		an error message will appear.
	</para>
	<para>
		A sequence of thirteen cards can be moved to a foundation pile.  Once
		there, these cards are no longer in play.
	</para>

	<sect2>Options</sect2>
	<para>None</para>

	<sect2>Scoring</sect2>
	<para>
		For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).
	</para>
	<para>
		Maximum possible score: 96
	</para>

	<sect2>Strategy</sect2>
	<para>
		Not quite as diabolical as the full spider game, but the same strategy applies:
		build in suit whenever possible, and expose as many cards as you can.
	</para>
