7 piles of 5 cards, face up. The remaining cards face down in a pile, with one removed
and placed face up next to it.

<bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
<para>
To remove as many cards as possible.
</para>
<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
The face up card can be matched with a card at the top of a pile if it is numerically adjacent to it
(aces are low), or either is a joker. The card it is matched with is placed on top of the face up card,
and the game continues.
</para>
<para>
If desired, you can move a card from the top of the face-down pile to the face-up pile.

<bridgehead>Scoring</bridgehead>
<para>
In order you get, 8, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8 for each type of card.. No points are
scored for jokers.
</para>
<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
Since you can see all the cards at the top, try to engineer `runs', to try and get rid of as many
cards up there as possible, as you only have a finite supply of backup cards.
</para>
<para>
This game is quite boring really.
