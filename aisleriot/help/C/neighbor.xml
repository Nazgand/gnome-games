			Five by five grid, each capable of holding one card.  One card dealt to
			each space at the beginning of game.  Empty spaces automatically filled
			by moving cards from the right to the left, from the leftmost card of
			the row below to the rightmost space, and from the Stock to all
			otherwise empty spaces.
