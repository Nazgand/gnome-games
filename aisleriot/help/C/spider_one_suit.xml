			Ten piles.  Four piles (piles 1, 4, 7, and 10) get dealt 5
			cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards
			down and one card up.  Cards can be built down in seqeunce and
			sequences of cards can be moved as a unit.  Empty piles
			can be filled with any card or movable unit.

	<sect2>Goal</sect2>
	<para>
		To have eight sequences of cards going down from King
		down to Ace in the foundation.
	</para>
	<para>
	        If you want an extra challenge, you can also win by forming the same eight sequences in the tableau. This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available.
	</para>

	<sect2>Rules</sect2>
	<para>
		Build down in sequence. Sequences of cards can
		be moved as a unit.  Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal
		sequence.
	</para>
	<para>
		Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
		pile.  However, all piles must be non-empty.  If an empty pile exists,
		an error message will appear.
	</para>
	<para>
		A sequence of thirteen cards can be moved to a foundation pile.  Once
		there, these cards are no longer in play.
	</para>

	<sect2>Scoring</sect2>
	<para>
		For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).
	</para>
	<para>
		Maximum possible score: 96
	</para>

	<sect2>Strategy</sect2>
	<para>
		This is the simplest of the spider games and a good way to learn the basics. Make sequences when you can and try and expose as many cards as possible.
	</para>
