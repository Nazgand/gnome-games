  <sect2>Goal</sect2>
  <para>
    Create four piles of thirteen cards each built down in suit and sequence.
  </para>

  <sect2>Rules</sect2>
  <para>
    Cards in Tableau can be built down regardless of suit.  Builds of
    cards in sequence and in the same suit can by moved as a unit.
    Empty Tableau piles can be filled with any card or build of cards.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each Tableau pile must be filled before any deal.  Clicking on the
    Stock will deal a card on to every Tableau pile except for the last
    deal which places one card on each of the first three piles.
  </para>
  <para>
    A build of all thirteen cards in a suit may be moved on to a
    Foundation pile.  Cards in the Foundation are no longer in play.
  </para>

  <sect2>Scoring</sect2>
  <para>
    Every pair of cards in suit and sequence scores one point.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score: 48
  </para>

  <sect2>Strategy</sect2>
  <para>
    Try to keep a Tableau pile empty whenever possible to create a swap
    space for moving around cards.
  </para>
