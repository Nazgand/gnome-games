Odessa is a little wonky.
	In particular, it needs to correctly score moving kings off and
cards over...
	Also, it doesn't check to see if you can move a king down.  Other
games all need scoring added.

I get an annoying flash when a card is hidden.  I am not sure why this
occurs yet, or even if it's universal.  I mean to try on a different
machine w/ different X-server to see if it happens there to, too.  I
think it may have to do with the way that the pixmaps are put on the
widget.
