DECK -- A 52 card poker deck.  There are four suits of thirteen cards
each.  Each suit contains an Ace, 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King.
These suits are usually Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds.  These suits
can be grouped into two colors, usually black and red.  The Clubs and
the Spaces are black while the Hearts and the Diamonds are red.
AisleRiot allows the possibility of using different decks.  In this
case, the new colors and/or suits are substituted into this paradigm.
