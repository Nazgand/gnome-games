// -------------------- Setup -----------------------------------

Number of Decks -- 1

Stock -- Top left pile.  The rest of the deck is placed here after
dealing the tableau.  Cards are turned over one at a time to waste.  Two
redeals.

Waste -- Directly to the right of Stock.  To be taken from stock.  Top
card available for play.

Reserve -- Middle (and lowest) slot.  Deal thirteen cards face down
here.  Flip card to fill any spaces in the tableau.  When only one
card is left in the reserve, it will flip up and can be played on
foundation or another slot.

Tableau -- Eight slots (four to the left and four to the right of
reserve.)  Deal one card face up per slot.  Tableau can be built down
by suit.  Cards can be moved singly to other slots on the tableau, or
in a group on to the foundation.  Each tableau slot can hold a maximum
of three cards.

Foundations -- Four piles top right.  Deal one card face up on first
foundation pile.  This card is now the base card.  Built up by suit.

// -------------------- Goal ------------------------------------

Move all cards to the foundation piles.

// -------------------- Rules -----------------------------------

Cards in the tableau are built down by suit.  Cards can only be moved
singly to another tableau slot.  However, to ease monotony, groups of
cards can be moved to foundation.  An empty slot in the tableau is
filled automatically from the reserve.  If the reserve is empty, an
empty slot can be filled by a card from the waste.

The reserve exists mainly to deal cards into empty slots of the
tableau.  However, when there is only one card left in the tableau, it
will become visible and is in play.

Cards are flipped from the stock to the waste singly.  When the stock
is empty, move all cards in waste back to the stock, maintaining
order.  You can go through the deck three times.

Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to
first foundation)  New foundations are started when a card of the same
rank as the first card placed during the dealing period are placed on
empty foundation piles.  Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on aces.
Cards in foundations are not in play.

// -------------------- Options ---------------------------------

// -------------------- Scoring ---------------------------------

Each card in the foundation piles scores one point.

Maximum possible score:  52

// -------------------- Strategy --------------------------------

Check before piling cards in a tableau.  Remember the three card in a
slot rule.
