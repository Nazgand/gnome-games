Copyright (C) 1998 Rosanna Yuen <rwsy@mit.edu>

// -------------------- Setup -----------------------------------

Number of Decks -- 1

Stock -- Top left pile.  The rest of the deck is placed here after
dealing the tableau.  Cards are turned over one at a time to waste.  Two
redeals.

Waste -- To be taken from stock.  Top card available for play.

Foundations -- Four piles top right.  To be built up in suit from Ace to
King.  Topmost card in each foundation can be played back on to the
tableau.

Tableau -- Seven piles.  Deal card face up in first pile.  Place one
card face down on all other piles.  Place one card face up on next pile
followed by one card face down on all covered piles.  Repeat until there
are seven cards in last pile.  Tableau can be built down in alternating
colors.  Groups of cards can be moved.

// -------------------- Goal ------------------------------------

Move all cards to the foundation piles.

// -------------------- Rules -----------------------------------

Cards in the tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the tableau can be filled with a
King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.

Cards are flipped from the stock to the waste individually.  Top card in
waste is in play.  When stock is empty, move all cards in waste back to
the stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.

Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in foundations
are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move it to the
appropriate foundation pile if such a move is possible.

// -------------------- Options ---------------------------------


// -------------------- Scoring ---------------------------------

Each card in the foundation piles scores one point.

Maximum possible score:  52

// -------------------- Strategy --------------------------------

Don't give up the ship!  Try brute force methods when the game seems
over.  Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the foundation
and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
