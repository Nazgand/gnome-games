How to compile AisleRiot on different platforms
===============================================

The AilseRiot code supports different platforms: GNOME, GTK only and Maemo.
To compile it for some platform, configure GNOME Games with

    ./configure --with-platform=gnome
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=gtk-only --with-games=aisleriot
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=hildon --with-platform-variant=maemo --with-games=aisleriot
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=hildon --with-platform-variant=maemo3 --with-games=aisleriot
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=hildon --with-platform-variant=mid --with-games=aisleriot

For GNOME and GTK-only, you can just install and run AisleRiot as normal.
Please refer to the scratchbox documentation about how to run AilseRiot in
scratchbox for the Maemo platform.


Notes about Maemo environment
=============================

On hildon the programme is started using DBUS service files;
org.gnome.Games.AisleRiot.service.in is our service file.
aisleriot-backup.conf is used to backup the programme's setting
using the device's backup manager, and aisleriot-clean.sh is used
to clean the setting on uninstall.


Environment variables
=====================

You can set the following environment variables to influence the
behaviour of AisleRiot:

GAMES_CARD_THEME_PATH_{SVG,KDE,SLICED,FIXED,PYSOL}:
  Values: a colon-separated list of paths
  Default: empty

    Set these variables to add extra paths to check for card themes.

GAMES_DEBUG:
  Values: use GAMES_DEBUG=help to see the list of available debug flags
  Default: empty

    Enabled extra debug output. Only available if configured with
  --enable-debug.

AISLERIOT_PIXBUF_DRAWING:
  Values: 0 or 1
  Default: 1 (hildon: 0)
  
    Set to 0 to disable pixbuf drawing and use pixmap drawing instead. Pixbuf
  drawing has the benefit of using full alphachannels, eliminating ugly
  rendering artifacts caused by the 1-bit alphachannels of the pixmaps.
  Might be a bit slower though.
