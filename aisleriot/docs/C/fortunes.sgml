To remove all cards except the four Aces.
</para>
<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Aces are high cards.  When two cards of the same suit are available,
the one with the lower rank can be removed.  When an empty slot
appears, move any group of cards to fill.

<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
There is no reason to have an empty slot when dealing another batch of
cards.  However, when you have an empty slot, try to keep it empty as
long as possible, as this is a great way to get rid of buried cards
