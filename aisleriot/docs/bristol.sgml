<bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
<para>
Move all cards to the Foundation piles.
</para>
<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Cards in the Tableau are built down regardless of suit.  Cards can
only be moved singly.  An empty pile in the Tableau can not be filled.
</para>
<para>
Cards are flipped from the Stock on to the three Reserve piles, one
card each per deal.  Top card of each Reserve pile is available for
play.  Empty Reserve piles cannot be filled except with the next deal
from Stock.
</para>
<para>
Foundation piles are built up regardless of suit from Ace to King.
Cards in Foundation are no longer in play.

<bridgehead>Scoring</bridgehead>
<para>
Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.

<para>
Maximum possible score:  52
</para>
<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
Never look backwards.  Cards that are locked in backwards order are to
be dealt with as soon as possible.  Move as many cards from the
Reserve on to the Tableau as you can, for Kings are hard to move.
