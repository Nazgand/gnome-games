>A 52 card poker deck. There are four suits of thirteen cards each.  Each suit contains an Ace, 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King.
These suits are usually Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds.  These suits
can be grouped into two colors, usually black and red.  The Clubs and
the Spaces are black while the Hearts and the Diamonds are red.
AisleRiot allows the possibility of using different decks.  In this
case, the new colors and/or suits are substituted into this paradigm.</P

>The value of the card. Numbered cards usually have the rank of the associated number.  Aces can either be high or low.  If high,
aces are ranked 1.  If low, aces are ranked as 14.  J, Q, and K are
usually ranked 11, 12, and 13 respectively.  However, some games may
rank these cards as 10.  In such a case, a high ace might be ranked as
11.</P
