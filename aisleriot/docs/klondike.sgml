<bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
<para>
Move all cards to the foundation piles.
</para>
<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Cards in the tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the tableau can be filled with a
King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
</para>
<para>
Cards are flipped from the stock to the waste individually.  Top card in
waste is in play.  When stock is empty, move all cards in waste back to
the stock, maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.
</para>
<para>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in foundations
are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move it to the
appropriate foundation pile if such a move is possible.
</para>
<bridgehead>Options</bridgehead>
<bridgehead>Scoring</bridgehead>
<para>
Each card in the foundation piles scores one point.
</para>
<para>
Maximum possible score:  52
</para>
<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
Don't give up the ship!  Try brute force methods when the game seems
over.  Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the foundation
and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
