>Rules</H2
><P
>Cards in the tableau are built down by suit.  Cards can only be moved
singly to another tableau slot.  However, to ease monotony, groups of
cards can be moved to foundation.  An empty slot in the tableau is
filled automatically from the reserve.  If the reserve is empty, an
empty slot can be filled by a card from the waste.</P
><P
>The reserve exists mainly to deal cards into empty slots of the
tableau.  However, when there is only one card left in the tableau, it
will become visible and is in play.</P
><P
>Cards are flipped from the stock to the waste singly.  When the stock
is empty, move all cards in waste back to the stock, maintaining
order.  You can go through the deck three times.</P
><P
>Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to
first foundation)  New foundations are started when a card of the same
rank as the first card placed during the dealing period are placed on
empty foundation piles.  Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on aces.
Cards in foundations are not in play.</P

>Options</H2

>Scoring</H2

>Each card in the foundation piles scores one point.</P

>Maximum possible score:  52</P

>Strategy</H2

>Check before piling cards in a tableau.  Remember the three card in a
slot rule</P
