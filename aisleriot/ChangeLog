2003-07-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* spider.scm: Made the ending condition a little less aggressive
	and more like spiderette. Patch from Paolo Borelli.

2003-06-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* ten_across.scm (less-than-same-cards): Removed some diagnostic
	code that shouldn't be there.

	* *.scm: Changes to remove trailing spaces in translatable
	strings.

	* aisleriot.schemas.in: Remove periods from the end of short
	descriptions.

2003-06-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* menu.c: Remove the dirent.h include since we don't need it
	anymore and it can upset FreeBSD if we don't also include
	sys/types.h which is also unneeded.

2003-06-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* sol.c (new_game): Fix Jon's crash-at-start bug. If the game was
	unplayable from the start (fortress could do this) then it 
	would do weird shit and possibly crash. This would also have
	caused anti-social behaviour on the occasional new game.

2003-06-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* slot.h: 
	* slot.c:
	* card.c:

	* events.c: 
	* cscmi.c: 
	* dialog.c: 
	* sol.c: 
	* slot.c:
	* splash.c: Compile fixes.

2003-06-16  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* slot.c: 
	* card.h: 
	* card.c:
	* draw.c: Use pixbuf for slot image.  This solves the problem of
	unmasked pixels in the corners of the slot pixmaps.

	* dialog.c: Fix compiler warning.
	
2003-06-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* sol.scm (redo): Horrific thinko. #f is a little different from #t.

2003-06-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* menu.c:
	* sol.c: i18n fixes from Christian Neumair (bug #114875).
	
	* valentine.scm (button-clicked): () is not actually valid
	scheme. 1.3.4 allowed it 1.6 doesn't. Replaced with the equivalent
	'(). Fixes bug #114850.

	* dialog.c (show_preferences_dialog): Use games_frame because it
	looks cool.

2003-06-10  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* *.scm: Replace ":  " by ": ". There is no reason to lengthen the
	status bar messages by one space.

2003-06-09  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* dialog.c: 
	* sol.c: Removed separator from dialogs as in HIG.

2003-06-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* events.c: Re-implement the third-button-reveals-card
	thing. Fixes bugs 103646.

2003-06-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c: Make the preferences dialog auto-apply and HIG
	compliant. The options are still there, they just look prettier.

2003-06-06  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c: Change the game over/won dialog to be an information
	box rather than a question since the message isn't actually a
	question (although the player does have a choice). Also changed
	the wording to use sentence capitalisation.

	* sol.scm: Do the scheme end of the undo/redo sensitivity code.

	* sol.c (new_game): Set the undo/redo buttons to
	insensitive at the beginning of a game.

	* cscmi.c: The C <-> scheme interface for settings the undo and
	redo button sensitivity.

	* menu.h:
	* menu.c: The C end of the undo/redo sensitivity code.

	* sol.c: Take advantage of the gconf support routines in
	libgames-support.

	* .cvsignore: Ignore the schemas file.

	* dialog.c
	* sol.c
	* menu.c
	* aisleriot.schemas.in: - -> _ because the spec says we can't use
	it.

2003-06-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c (property_apply): 
	* sol.h: 
	* Makefile.am: 
	* aisleriot.schemas.in: Aisleriot now uses gconf.

	* sol.c (quit_app): Don't ask if quit has been selected. Trust the
	user.

	* menu.h: 
	* sol.c:
	* menu.c: Reorganised the menu and the toolbar so that they match
	each other in terms of order and tooltips. Also give the hint
	toolbar button the "help" lifesaver that all the other games do.
	Added an option to toggle the toolbar on and off.
	
2003-06-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c (show_select_game_dialog): Updates to the select dialog
	to avoid flickering and make resizing behave. Fixes bug #114327.

2003-06-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* sol.scm: Added a wrapper for eval so it runs on modern guiles
	which actually do what R5RS says while still running on 1.3. Fixes
	bug #114191.

2003-05-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (scoredir): Removed since it was unused.

2003-05-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* .cvsignore: Add freecell.desktop.

2003-05-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c (show_preferences_dialog): Use gtk_window_present to
	display dialogs.

2003-05-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* plait.scm: 
	* fortunes.scm: 
	* eagle_wing.scm: 
	* sol.scm (get-name): Rather than constructing cards from the suit
	and value do them all individually. This is to help the
	translators. The word "the" has also been moved to the beginning of
	the descriptions rather than the format strings.

2003-05-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* first_law.scm (removable?): More i18n fixes.

	* plait.scm: 
	* fortunes.scm: 
	* eagle_wing.scm: Replaced the case 3 hint with an easier to
	translate case 0 hint.

	* dialog.c (show_hint_dialog): Deprecated case 3 hints since they
	are too hard to translate.

	* first_law.scm (removable?): 
	* sol.scm: i18n fixes, removed the string concatenations.

2003-05-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c (show_select_game_dialog): Select the current game as
	the default. Fixes bug #113113.

2003-05-21  Malcolm Tredinnick <malcolm@commsecure.com.au>

	* Makefile.am: Now that SCHEME_GAMES.h has had its build rules
	removed, it is better not to try and build it.

2003-05-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* sol.c (new_game): Fixed a warning when trying to put
	game-specific stuff in the help menu.

	* Makefile.am: Removed the code to generate SCHEME_GAMES.h, we
	don't need it anymore.

	* cscmi.c (cscm_init): gettext -> _

	* *.scm: Changed all the "gettext" calls to "_" so we don't have
	to alter intltools.

2003-05-18  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Arranged for the autogeneration of SCHEME_GAMES.h
	since I don't understand how to get the strings automatically
	extracted from the .scm files using intltool.

2003-05-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* *.scm: Updated the scheme files to use the new gettext
	call.

	* sol.c: Changed the code so that using --variation to select a
	game only works for that one session. This is an awful hack, but I
	can't see a better way to do it.

2003-05-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* klondike.scm (get-options): 
	* poker.scm (get-hint): Added gettext calls in the scheme code.

	* dialog.c (show_hint_dialog): 
	* cscmi.c (scm_gettext): Added a scheme wrapper for gettext. Now
	if only we could extract the strings from the schemes files ...

	* Makefile.am: Created a freecell emulation desktop entry.

	* menu.c: Removed reference to scroll-menu.h. I did remember to
	test, I just didn't test properly :(.

2003-05-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Removed scroll-menu.*, the code isn't used anymore.

2003-05-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removing the old pixmaps directory. 600k
	of pixmaps that aren't used by anything.

	* sol.h: 
	* card.h: Remove pathnames in include directives. The correct path
	to gdk-card-image.h is now handled in Makefile.am .

	* Makefile.am: Updated to allow for the movement of the
	gdk-card-image code.

2003-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* events.c: Re-implemented the double-click code to ensure double
	click events don't happen when the second click is on a different
	card. Fixes #102449

2003-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* dialog.c (show_select_game_dialog): More changes to try and
	improve the "Select" dialog. As per bug #110730.

	* menu.c: Renamed the "New game of..." item to "Select...", the
	justification for this can be found in bug #110730.

2003-05-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* yukon.scm (check-a-tableau): Finally applying my fix to bug
	#64236.

2003-04-30  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

2003-04-06  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* agnes.scm: Fix hints, thanks to
	kyamada@psg.cs.titech.ac.jp. Closing #90103.

2003-01-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* freecell.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme. This may fix bug
	#83517 (it certainly fixes a bug and the symptoms in #83517 fit
	the profile).

	* plait.scm:  Updated undo/redo to new scheme.

	* labyrinth.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme.

	* glenwood.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme. Fixes a
	previously undiscovered bug.

	* eight_off.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme. This fixes a
	previously undetected bug.

	* chessboard.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme.

	* camelot.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme.

	* bakers_game.scm: Updated undo/redo to new scheme. Refixes
	#91101/#90905.

	* seahaven.scm: Removed the old undo/redo code in favour of the
	new transparent scheme. Should be a better fix for the
	bugs #65242/#89540 (already closed).

	* sol.scm: Added transparent support for undo/redo of variables in
	individual games. The variables that were already being saved have
	not been altered to use this method.

2003-03-07  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* sol.c: Fix up compile warnings.

2003-03-03  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* dialog.c: Remove the headers from the New Game dialog, and inset
	the table.

	* menu.c (help_about_callback): Set the About dialog as transient
	for the main window.

	* menu.c:(help_about_callback): Remove the evil "New game of..."
	sub-menu, and use the "Select" dialog which nobody knew existed.

2002-12-11  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* dialog.c: Allow the user to have a choice in the Game Won
	dialog. Slightly edited patch from pborelli@katamail.com, closing
	#100120.

	* gnome-aisleriot.png: New icon contributed by Timothy Musson.

2002-10-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* klondike.scm (get-hint): Fixed an off-by-one error in checking
	FLIP-COUNT and also added a default "no hint available" message
	for the extremely rare situation where you can't move anything off
	the foundation decks. It's still a completely unsatisfactory
	answer to the klondike hints problem, but my brain hurts too much
	tonight to fix it. Mostly fixes #85712.

2002-10-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* seahaven.scm: Added (record-move) and (undo-func) so that the
	free-reserves variable is set correctly after an undo. This may be
	the cause of bug #65242.

2002-09-30  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* events.c (button_press_event): Fix very stupid code (== instead
	of =), closing #89822. Thanks to Callum McKenzie for being such a
	lisp star :)

2002-09-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* ten_across.scm: Removed give-status-message and all references
	to it. This should fix bug #94078. It seems to be cut-and-paste
	residue and is unnecessary in this particular game.

2002-09-23  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* spider.scm (button-clicked): Fix #84498 with a patch from Callum
	McKenzie <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

2002-08-20  Gustavo Giraldez  <gustavo.giraldez@gmx.net>

2002-07-04  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* canfield.scm: canfield didn't know when the game was over. Also
	fix a off-by-one in "deal-possible?". Closes #74185.

	* Makefile.am: install the desktop file in $(datadir)/applications

2002-04-30  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	translation file header showing up in status bar.
