1998-08-10  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* sol.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.

1998-06-25  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* sol.scm: Remove dependency on (ice-9 slib) module; it's not
	actually used, AFAIK and the game works fine without it.

	* sol.c (main_prog): Use (defined? 'provide), not (procedure?
	'provide) to test wether boot-9.scm has been loaded; uncomment the
	test, as it should now work with both Guile 1.2 and recent
	snapshots.

Fri May  1 06:03:57 1998  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@mit.edu>
	* press_data.c (generate_press_data): removed masking for moving cards (added 4/24)
	This is because stacks are moved occaisionally...
	* klondike.scm: No longer seg_faults when double clicked.  Klondike now works fine
	again

1998-04-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* press_data.c (generate_press_data): Doh.  Logical or is not the
	same as bitwise or.  This is why the window attributes were not
	being set correctly.

	* press_data.c (generate_press_data): Set the window shape to the
	mask bitmap to drag cards with rounded corners.

	* card.c: Made it use imlib for loading pixmaps.

	* *.xpm: renamed to allow inclusion in C files...
	* FIXME: updated... (:
	* pixmap/cards.h: allows easy inclusion of C files.
	* card.c: Now compiles in the cards.

	* dialog.c: Use gnome_message_box_*, not gnome_messagebox_*.

1998-03-1  Jonathan Blandford <jrb@mit.edu>
	* sol.c: Removed changes to work with recent snapshots below.  They 
	seemed to cause stack-overflows with guile 1.2
