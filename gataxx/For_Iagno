The plan is to merge in iagno a bit at a time. This is a partial list of
what needs to be implemented/imported:

 - Sound support.
 - Network support.
 - Iagno AI.
 - Iagno/gataxx command line switches.
 - Multiple desktop entries (in the same file ?)
 - Import the iagno icon.
 - Move across the tile-sets.
 - Rewrite drawing code to be scalable (not exactly a merge item).

Also note the usability bugs in bugzilla related to iagno.
