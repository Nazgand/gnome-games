	* gtkgridboardthemes.c: 
	* gtkgridboardthemes.h: 
	* gtkgridboard.h: 
	* gtkgridboard.c: <cairo/cairo.h> -> <cairo.h>. Spotted by
	l.hancock3@ntlworld.com.

2006-02-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gtkgridboard.c (gtk_gridboard_set_theme): Make a theme change
	invalidate the backing pixmap. I'd become too clever with my
	redraw-avoidance schemes and the theme didn't redraw properly.

	* properties.c: Remove the custom clamp_int in favour of glib's
	CLAMP macro. In the process also make sure it is used properly.

2006-01-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gtkgridboardthemes.c: New theme: Squares and Diamonds.

	* properties.c (set_selection): Fix the new code so it will work
	when the UI is translated.

2005-12-31  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gataxx.schemas.in:
	* gataxx.c: 
	* gataxx.h: 
	* properties.c:
	* properties.h: 
	* gtkgridboard.c: 
	* gtkgridboard.h:
	* gtkgridboardthemes.c:
	* gtkgridboardthemes.h:
	* Makefile.am: Resurrected theme support. It is all internal
	drawing code for now, image files are no longer supported. There
	is still only one theme, but the framework for new themes - and
	some degree of "inheritance" is there.

2005-10-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* gataxx.schemas.in: 
	* gataxx.c: 
	* properties.h: 	
	* properties.c: Remove the separate "flip final" option. The final
	flip is performed if animation is requested. Also move the
	PropertiesData definition inside properties.c since it is private.

2005-09-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* properties.c: 
	* properties.h:
	* gataxx.c:
	* gtkgridboard.h:
	* gtkgridboard.c: Use a simpler, slicker, faster drawing
	style. The selection is now drawn as "ghost pieces" (hence
	simplifying the grid code). The grid option has been removed. The
	drawing engine is back to using a backing store. We now keep track
	of what has changed and only redraw that. Also removed a lot of
	profiling code since the total time is the only really relevant
	bit. The resulting code is now easily fast enough (30ms worst-case
	redraw on my machine). 

2005-08-12  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: Yet another revision of the Cairo drawing
	code. I have ditched the pixmaps and now draw everything purely
	through Cairo primitives. Since I am using gradients it is still a
	little slow (200ms on a full board vs. 100ms ideal). Without the
	gradients it is 25ms/frame, but doesn't look right. Nearly there.

2005-08-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: Make the cairo drawing routines a lot faster by
	removing drawing of empty space, putting the pixbuf on its own
	surface and drawing everything directly to the window. Also moved
	the contents of the cairo context setup and destroy functions into
	gtk_gridboard_repaint. Unfortunately it is still about a factor of
	3 too slow for animation on a full board (and feels slow all the
	time, but only about 1.5 times too slow for animation).

	* properties.c: Added context tags as per the request in bug
	#312802.

2005-08-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: Save the window size between runs.

	* gataxx.c:
	* gtkgridboard.c:
	* gtkgridboard.h: Revamp of the drawing code. gtk_gridboard_paint
	is the only function the program calls to do any drawing. This
	removes the glitch problems, but is incredibly slow.

	* gtkgridboard.h: 
	* gtkgridboard.c: Remove gtk_gridboard_clear_pixmaps. It is unused
	and unnecessary.

	* gtkgridboard.c: Add a gtk_gridboard prefix to present_region,
	setup_cairo_context, destroy_cairo_context.

2005-08-06  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Remove the mention of the
	no-longer-existing bug reporting guidelines. See bug #312723.

2005-08-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: Mostly working Cairo graphics. Still full of
	drawing glitches, inefficiencies and warning messages, but
	playable. The window is resizeable, but the size isn't saved
	between games.

2005-08-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: 
	Add a gridframe to keep the board square. Remove an unnecessary
	including of games-clock.h.

	* gtkgridboard.c: Move the global timeoutid into the gobject.
	Replace the use of memset with g_malloc0 and remove the dependence
	on string.h.

2005-08-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: 
	* gtkgridboard.h: Rebuilding the drawing system to be scalable
	using Cairo. Not exactly efficient right now.

	* gataxx.c: 
	* classic.png:
	* Makefile.am: Moved the theme to a new location with a new format
	(1x32 rather than 4x8). Temporarily moved classic.png from iagno
	to here since it is in a different format.

2005-07-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/figures/*
	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Bumped the version numbers. Redo the
	screenshots.

2005-07-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* appbar.c: Patch from Paolo Borelli to change the gnoem_appbar to
	a gtk_statusbar.

2005-07-22  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Rule clarification and update, #311126. 

2005-07-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: Invalidate the selection after an undo, it won't be
	either displayed or for the correct colour. See bug #310984,

	* gtkgridboard.c: When undoing a move, clear the selection (and
	redraw the board) with the old data. Fixes bug #311001.
	I also broke out the grid drawing code from gtk_gridboard_paint in
	a failed attempt to fix the bug. This might be useful when we redo
	the graphics engine and can properly delete grid lines.

2005-07-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.h: 
	* gataxx.c: 
	* properties.c: Remove get_gconf_uri () and replace it with static
	#defined strings. This costs 16 bytes more, but rewriting
	get_gconf_uri so it isn't so evil and error-prone will cost more
	than 16 bytes.

2005-05-09  Alan Horkan <horkana tcd ie>

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Removed Known Bugs sections where not needed.

2005-04-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: Make sure that if the player is changed from computer
	to human before the computer-play timeout has gone off that we
	don't go into an infinite loop. Bug #300407. Rather than keep
	track of timeout IDs and explicitly remove them, we just do a
	sanity check in computer_move_cb ().

2005-04-11  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gataxx.c (quit_game_cb): Add a check to timeoutid source removal.
	(about_cb): Use GtkAboutDialog.

2005-03-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Patches from Dennis Cranston
	<dennis_cranston@yahoo.com> to make the game more HIG compliant.

2005-03-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Bump the app version number. No revisions.

2005-02-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Translate "Human". This is already translated
	elsewhere so it doesn't count as a string-freeze break. Thanks to
	Nickolay V. Shmyrev for the patch (bug #167175).

2005-02-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.h:
	* gtkgridboard.c:	
	* gataxx.c: Actually fix bug #162892. Two issues: Firstly
	Richard's patch didn't do the extern thing properly and there were
	two definitions of timeoutid. Secondly there were two calls to
	gtk_gridboard_set_animate but onlly one timer was being
	killed. The definition of timeoutid is now fixed and
	gtk_gridboard_set_animate now aborts if there is already a timeout
	defined.

2005-01-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.h: 
	* gtkgridboard.c:
	* gtkgridboard.h: Patch from Richard which should fix bug
	#162892, but doesn't. It is a good idea in any case.

2005-01-21  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gataxx.c (save_state_cb): Redone, no longer crashes. Bug #164806. 

2005-01-13  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gtkgridboard.h:
	* gtkgridboard.c (gtk_gridboard_set_visibility): New. Hides moves,
	allowing AI to plan future moves in secret.

	* ai.h: Set most functions so they would be local to ai.c
	* ai.c (computer_move): Disable visibility of moves while doing ai.
	
2005-01-10  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* gtkgridboard.c (gtk_gridboard_button_press): Fix for bug #163088.
	Range clamping intended to support grid's new single-pixel border.

2004-12-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: Fall back to a default if the theme isn't found.
	(Josselin Mouette, bug #160682.)

2004-12-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask -> gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask_for_colormap.

2004-11-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Patch from Paolo Borelli <pborelli@katamail.com>
	to fix a resource leak for tooltips.

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Documentation update from Sjoerd Langkemper
	<sjoerd-games linuxonly nl>.

2004-10-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.h: 
	* gataxx.c:
	* ai.h:
	* ai.c:
	* gtkgridboard.h:	
	* gtkgridboard.c: Massive cleanups. GtkWidget -> GtkGridBoard to
	assist type safety. More checks on input values for public
	functions.

2004-10-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: Clear the selection when we undo a move. Fixes
	bug #152706.

2004-10-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: Use g_malloc rather than g_try_malloc for
	make_array. We aren't going to handle the results gracefully so we
	might as well use the standard failure mode: abort the program.
	
	Also do some cleanups and add some more checks and start
	converting the "this" pointer from GtkWidget to GtkGridBoard.

	Add an extra pixel all around so we draw the rightmost and
	bottommost frames. Also fix the expose routine so we draw the 
	grid lines correctly.
	
2004-10-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gtkgridboard.c: Fix a 64-bit crasher and g_-ize some
	libc-isms. See bug #153803 for details on the crasher.  Also call
	the correct handler to free memory. Fixes bug #154271.

2004-10-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c (new_game): Set the counter count when loading from the
	command line.

2004-09-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: Set the light/dark's move correctly on an undo.

2004-09-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c (new_game): Swap the pieces so that the top left player
	starts (as per other Ataxx implementations, including play-by-mail
	ones). See bug #152609.
	Also, remove horrendous bug where we hardcoded the pathname for 
	the tileset data.
	Also update the counters after an undo (bug #152701).

2004-09-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c (restore_state): Fix a goof with colouring the squares
	which are valid moves.

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Gataxx -> Ataxx and updates for 2.8.

2004-05-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c:
	* properties.c: Fix compiler warnings.

2004-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (gataxx_SOURCES): Add ai.h.

2004-04-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Free the file list when the properties dialog is
	destroyed.

2004-03-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* ai.*:
	* appbar.*:
	* gataxx.*:
	* gtkgridboard.*:
	* menus.*:
	* properties.*:
	* Makefile.am: Import Sjoerd Langkemper's rewrite. This also
	includes several changes to bring the new gataxx into line with
	the old one. The important ones are: White now starts, the timer
	has gone, session management should save the state of the game.
	
	* ataxx.c:
	* ataxx.h: Removed, replaced by ai.[ch].

	* For_Iagno: Added to the repository: a list of what needs to be
	done for the Iagno merge.

	* Makefile.am: 
	* sounds/*:
	* gataxx.soundlist.in:	
	* TODO: Remvoe the sound infrastructure, it seems to have never
	been used and it is identical to what iagno has. I'll add sound
	support when I merge in iagno. Also remove TODO since it is out of
	date.

2004-03-06  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: A simple adaption of jrb's iagno patch for fixing
	bug #136236.

2004-02-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Update version to 2.6.

2004-02-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c (about_cb): translator_credits ->
	translator-credits.

2003-10-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@localhost.localdomain>

	* Makefile.am: Removed *_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

2003-10-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Change the way gconf files are
	installed. This should improve things for people building outside
	the source tree. See bug #123192.

2003-10-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Replace functions deprecated in GTK+2.4.

2003-09-13  Steve Chaplin

       * properties.c (fill_menu): g_free() unused memory.
       * gataxx.c (gui_draw_selected): g_object_unref() object we have
       finished using.

Tue Aug  5 10:24:33 2003  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c (clamp_int): Suppress a compiler warning.

2003-08-04  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Clean up the gataxx_gconf_get_* code to use the
	gconf_client_get_* functions. Also do some range checking on
	results from gconf.

2003-08-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: 
	* gataxx.c: 
	* Makefile.am (pixmapdir): Share pixmaps with iagno since they
	are identical.

2003-08-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c: Make sure that timers are removed so that we don't
	get odd speed-up effects when we change animation modes.

	* gataxx.h: 
	* gataxx.c: The code was set for an 7x4 array of pixmaps,
	unfortunately the pixmaps are in an 8x4 array ... Also simplified
	the "partial" animation.

	* help/C/gataxx.xml: Updated the documentation (including the
	images).

2003-07-22  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* properties.c (show_properties_dialog): Use mnemonic in preferences
	notebook tab label for keyboard navigation.

2003-07-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c (create_window): Dropped the g from the window title.

2003-07-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.desktop.in: Update name to fit HIG (bug 116916).

2003-06-27  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gataxx.h: Fixed off by one error in BOARDHEIGHT and BOARDWIDTH.

2003-06-20  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: Only make the undo button sensitive when it has to
	be.

2003-06-18  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* properties.c: Included string.h.

	* gataxx.c (main): Changed gtk_widget_set_uposition to
	gtk_window_move.

2003-06-17  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gataxx.c: 
	* gataxx.h:
	* properties.c:
	* properties.h:
	* ataxx.c:
	* ataxx.h: Fixed compiler warnings.

2003-06-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c (quit_game_cb): Removed the last "are you sure"
	questions.
	

	* properties.c (show_properties_dialog): Correct the preferences title.

2003-06-11  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: i18n fixes from Christian Neumair (bug #114875).

2003-06-10  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gataxx.c: Removed separators from status bar.

	* properties.c (show_properties_dialog): HIG fixes.

2003-06-09  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gataxx.c: Removed separator from dialogs as in HIG.

2003-06-05  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Only install schemas
	if they are requested.

2003-06-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.c: 
	* gataxx.h (struct _MoveHistory): 
	* ataxx.c: Changed the save structure from a static array to a
	linked list. This allows an infinite number of moves rather than
	the fixed number used before (the buffer had room for a reasonable,
	but exhaustible, 500 entries, but then used a signed 8-bit
	counter. SO after 128 turns the program crashed trying to access
	turn -128. Fixes bug #113770.

2003-06-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* properties.c:
	* ataxx.c:
	* gataxx.c: gtk_timeout* -> g_source*, plus cleanups to the same
	code . Fixes bug #103280.

2003-05-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (scoredir): Changed score directory to fix bug
	#113968.

2003-05-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gataxx.schemas.in: Well gataxx has been completely
	non-functional for the last two months since Ross applied the
	sanity checks. Unfortunately the gataxx schemas file wasn't sane.
	Fixes bug #110813.

2003-04-30  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* ChangeLog: Convert to UTF-8.

2003-03-07  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gataxx.c: Add a GConf sanity check.

2003-02-09  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* properties.c (load_properties): g_strdup() a literal string so
	that g_free()ing it later doesn't crash.

2002-12-17  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* Makefile.am (schema_in_files): Fix the GConf schema path.

2002-11-29  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Put the source of the schemas in the
	dist, not the generated files.

2002-11-27  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gataxx.c: s/Gnome/GNOME/, for #99683.

2002-11-25  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* Makefile.am: Fixed the GConf install location, thanks to Loz
	<gnome2@flower.powernet.co.uk>. Closes #99393.

2002-11-18  Fernando Herrera <fherrera@onirica.com>

	* gataxx.desktop.in: add X-GNOME-BUGZILLA stuff

2002-11-19  Jeremy Browne  <jeremy@synonymous.ca>

	* gataxx.c: Changes to quit / new game dialogs for consistency with
	other parts of gnome-games package. (Bug #97321)

2002-11-11  Tim Musson <trmusson@ihug.co.nz>

	* properties.c: (show_properties_dialog): Multiple open properties
	  dialogs no longer possible (fixes #97320 for gataxx).
	  Replaced the OK button with a Close button (#97322).
	* gataxx.c: (about_cb): gtk_window_present gives focus to dialog

2002-08-18  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gataxx.c (quit_game_cb): Make the Quit dialog conform to the
	HIG. Patch from Samuel Stringham <sams@e-sa.com>, fixing #73031.

2002-08-17  Juan Pablo Mendoza  <jpablo@gnome.org>

        * sunmoon.png: New file by DarkAlloy.
        * Makefile.am: Add sunmoon.png.

2002-06-02  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gataxx.c (load_pixmaps): Use the application pixmap path,
	instead of the system. Causes gataxx to work when installed in a
	different prefix to libgnome.
	* properties.c (fill_menu): Ditto.

2002-05-05  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* help/C/gataxx-C.omf: updated for new format of SK 0.3.8.
	* help/C/Makefile.am: updated for new format of SK 0.3.8.

2002-04-17  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gataxx.desktop.in: rename gataxx to Gataxx in the desktop file
	(Closes: #75952)

2002-04-16  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gataxx.schemas: added

	Stratman)), have a nice icon in the about box, more porting

2002-04-15  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gataxx.c: (save_state): remove nstr(), patch from
	r_kinder@yahoo.com (Richard Kinder)

2002-02-26  Juan Pablo Mendoza <jpablo@gnome.org>

	* Makefile.am:

	* gataxx.c (about_cb): Don't try to translate empty string.

2002-01-08  Josh Barrow  <drleary@mac.com>

	* properties.c: (show_properties_dialog):
	Let it know that it's parent is window and made it have 
	no separator just above the buttons.

2002-01-06  Josh Barrow  <drleary@mac.com>

	* properties.c: (load_properties), (apply_changes),
	(quick_moves_select), (flip_final_select), (fill_menu),
	(show_properties_dialog):
	First try at porting this to GTK_DIALOG.  No longer do 
	I believe that buttonless dialogs are the way to go.
	Also, some whitespace fixes and horrible coding style 
	fixes.

2002-01-02  Josh Barrow  <drleary@mac.com>

	* properties.c: (fill_menu):
	Change use of GtkSignalFunc to G_CALLBACK

	* Makefile.am:
	* clock.c: (update_clock):
	* gataxx.c: (quit_game_cb), (about_cb), (expose_event),
	(configure_event), (gui_draw_pixmap), (gui_draw_pixmap_buffer),
	(load_pixmaps), (init_new_game), (create_window), (gui_status),
	(set_bg_color), (main):

	(white_computer_level_select), (quick_moves_select),
	(flip_final_select), (animate_select), (set_selection),
	(fill_menu), (show_properties_dialog):

	Made to compile and run with G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED,
	GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATEd, GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED, and 
	GNOME_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.  Also rewrote the preferences 
	dialog to make it instant apply. (The rewrite was initally
	required becuase gnome_properties_dialog is deprecated)

	This will most certainly make Greg happy.  ; D
