    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
     <application>&app;</application> is a puzzle game where you try
     and find the location of mines floating in an ocean using only
     your brain and a little bit of luck.
    </para>

    <para>
      You start the game with a grid of blank squares - you
      have no idea what is in them. Clicking on a square shows you
      what is under it, either empty ocean or a mine. If you
      find a mine bad things happen and the game is over. To make the
      game longer and more fun, if you find an empty piece of ocean
      a number is printed there telling you how many mines are in the 
      adjacent squares (or no number if there are no nearby
      mines). Once you find a few clear squares you can start to
      deduce which squares have mines in them and which don't. You win
      the game once you have revealed all the un-mined squares and
      marked where all the mines are.
    </para>

    </figure>

    <para>
      To mark a square as having a mine you right-click on it and a
      flag is placed there. If you click on a square with a number and
      you have placed precisely that number of flags on adjacent
      squares then the remaining squares are revealed. If you didn't
      mark the mines correctly then an explosion will occur and
      once-again the game is over. Squares with no adjacent mines
      (i.e. blank squares) have the adjacent squares automatically cleared.

    <para>
      Also, you are being timed. You have to work quickly - and
      correctly. Once you have found all the mines and revealed all
      the un-mined squares the timer is stopped. The shorter the time
      you take, the better.
    </para>

    <para>
      The time you have taken is displayed on the bottom right of the
      window. Beside it on the left is a count of the number of mines 
      you have cleared and the total number hidden on the board.

      <title>The Goal</title>

      <para>
        Starting from an ocean of squares with unknown contents
	you must mark all the squares with mines and reveal all the
	clear squares. Actually you don't have to mark the squares with mines,
	but it is a lot easier if you do. Once you have cleared all
	the un-mined squares, any remaining mined squares will be
	marked for you.
      </para>

      <para>
	If you left click on a mine, or auto-clear a square with a mine
        in it you lose. To help prevent accidents, you aren't allowed
        to auto-clear around a square unless the number of marked
        mines equals the number given in the square.
      </para>

      <title>Game Size and Difficulty</title>

      <para>
        By choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the 
	 menu you can
        change the size of the games. Larger sizes obviously take longer
        and require more concentration. Smaller games are more
        frantic. We provide Small, Medium, Large and Custom
        sizes.
      </para>

    </figure>

      <para>
        On the right hand side of the dialog there are three
        parameters for controlling the custom size. Horizontal and
        Vertical are the width and height of the desired custom grid in
        squares. The number of mines is - obviously - the number of
        mines you need to find. If this number is set too high or too
        low then the game becomes very easy. The number of mines is
        limited to slightly less than the total number of squares.
      </para>

      <title>"I'm not sure" Flags</title>

      </figure>

      <para>
        There is one other check-box in the properties dialog entitled
        Use "I'm not sure" flags. If you enable this then when
        right-clicking on a square it cycles between the normal flags
        used to mark the square as mined, a flag with a question mark
        on it and no flag. This new flag is to help you with your
        reasoning, to mark mines you think might be a mine. These
        flags have no effect on the game; you still have to use the 
	appropriate  number of red marker flags to be able to clear
        around a numbered square.

      <title>Hints</title>
    
      <para>
        If you get stuck - it is reasonably common to end up with two
        options that you can't logically resolve - then you can either
        guess, or ask for a hint. When you choose 
	<guimenuitem>Hint</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Game</guimenu>
        menu then a single square will be revealed (plus surrounding
        squares if it is blank). The choice of square is not deterministic, but
        should be helpful. There is 10 second penalty added to your
        time whenever you use a hint.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>High Scores</title>

      <para>
        If your score is in the top ten then, when the game is over,
        you will be shown the list of top scores and have an
        opportunity to change the name you use in the list. You can
        also review the scores later by choosing 
	<guimenuitem>Scores</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Game</guimenu>
        menu. The drop-down menu at the top of the dialog lets you
        look at other categories.
      </para>

      <title>The high scores dialog.</title>
    </figure>

      <tip>
        The high score for the custom size is usually meaningless. Any
	other player can make the game size smaller and get a better time. If
        you only ever play one custom size then it will tell you how
	well you are doing. This is the reason it is still recorded.

    <sect2>
      <title>Window Size</title>
      
      <para>Resizing the window makes the squares bigger or smaller to
    suit. If you want to make maximum use of the screen then the
    <guimenuitem>Fullscreen</guimenuitem> option under the
    <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu will do what you want. You can
    also use <keycap>F11</keycap> key to toggle full-screen mode.

      <title>The Basics</title>
      <para>
        There are a few basic situations which should be incredibly
      obvious, but if you're struggling with how to play this game,
      they should be useful. The first is the case where you have an
      isolated uncovered square and every square around it reads
      1. That uncovered square is a mine. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The next simplest case is where you have two uncovered squares
        adjacent to each other and both squares on one side are marked
        with a 2. If they have no other uncleared neighbours, then
        both squares are mines.
      </para>
      <para>
        Finally, when there are three uncovered squares in a row and
        the clear square beside the middle one is a 3 (once again this
        square should have no other neighbours) then all three are mines.
      </para>
    </sect2>
