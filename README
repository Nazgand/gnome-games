Gnome-Games
===========

This package contains games for your GNOME desktop. It requires normal GNOME
2 packges plus guile for aisleriot and a c++ compiler to build GNOME Tetris.

The goal of these games is to amuse hackers and GNOME users during its
normal and productive work. They are also useful for avoiding normal
and productive work.

The Games:
==========
AisleRiot: Solitaire card games, lots of them. Klondike, Freecell,
           Spider, take your pick. Over 70 variations.
Blackjack: The casino card game without all the hassle of actually 
           owing money when you lose.
Lines: Align balls into coloured lines. AKA fiveormore.
Ataxx: A disc-flipping game similar to Othello (which we call Iagno).
Four-in-a-row: The classic four in a row game. You don't get to dump all the
               pieces out the bottom when you're finished though.
Nibbles: The "worm" game. Made popular again by cell phones.
Robots: The classic BSD robots game. Mac users might remember a similar 
        "daleks" game.
Stones: Mine through dirt and collect gems: but don't get
        squashed by the boulders. Also has a Sokoban mode.
Gnometris: The Russian game Tetris. Need I say more ?
Mines: The popular logic puzzle minesweeper.
Klotski: A sliding blocks game.
Tali: Sort of poker with dice and less money.
Iagno: Gnome version of the popular Othello disk flipping game.
Mahjongg: GNOME version of the Eastern tile game, Mahjongg.
Same GNOME: Remove as many balls in as few moves as possible.

Security
========

Some of these games take advantage of the Unix setgid feature to
control access to the high score tables. Specifically: the programs
that record high scores gain the privileges of the games group for
this purpose. For most people this is fine and safe. However, in some
cases this is not appropriate (e.g. the games group is used for other
purposes, or it doesn't exist) . If it isn't there are several options:
 - Change the group with the --with-scores-group option to configure.
   This sets the group for both the score files and the
   binaries. There is also a --with-scores-user option as well, but
   it is largely irrelevant. Both default to `games'.
 - Disable setgid support altogether with the --disable-setgid
   option. The scores files are still installed and you can control
   the user and group as above. Depending on how you set the
   permissions on the scores files this will either disable high
   score support or make cheating trivial. By default it will disable
   high score support.
