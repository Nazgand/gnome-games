ASAP:
* Clean up the code - remove global variables, smaller, more specialize classes, 
   less static methods etc.

Next:
* eliminate flicker with non-null background
* random pieces at the bottom in various difficulty levels
* configurable field size
* major redesign: tetris, jewel and trojka in one shell (Sergey's (sipan@mit.edu) idea)
