ASAP:
* change "fall like a rock" to "just fall quicker" on down-arrow
* Clean up the code - remove global variables, smaller, more specialize classes, 
   less static methods etc.

Next:
* changeable field background
* random pieces at the bottom in various difficulty levels
* configurable field size
* major redesign: tetris, jewel and trojka in one shell (Sergey's (sipan@mit.edu) idea)
