ASAP:
1. create stuff needed by automake/autoconf
2. Clean up the code - remove global variables
3. implement difficulty levels
4. make code managing key presses more buletproof

Next:
1. user preferences (starting level, show next block etc.)
2. remember preferences in configuration database - learn from same-gnome game how to do it
3. Center the block shown in preview pane

Would be Nice:
1. configurable block shapes and colors
