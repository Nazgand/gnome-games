      <title>Game objective</title>
      <para>The objective of the game is to get a high score by
      eliminating as many balls as possible in a single stroke.  If
      you eliminate only two balls, you will score zero points.  If
      you eliminate three balls, you will score one point. The more
      balls you eliminate in a single mouse click the higher your
      score will be.</para>

      <para>To faciliate the task of spotting the ball clusters, Same
      GNOME will animate the cluster of balls when the mouse is over
      them (this also indicates that if you click on the cluster, it
      will eliminate the balls)</para>

      <para>Eliminating all of the balls on the board will grant you
      an extra one thousand points</para>

      <para> This GNOME game was originally implemented by Miguel de
      Icaza and Federico Mena at early days of the GNOME project.  It
      was inspired by KDE's samegame which in turn was inspired
      by a Macintosh game of a similar name.</para>
      
      <para>A number of tiles were originated from the KDE
      project. The planets tile was rendered by Federico in his
      copious spare time to show the world his masterful control of
      povray command language.</para>

  <sect1 id="newthemes">
    <title>Making new themes for Same GNOME</title>
      <para>Making new animation themes for Same GNOME is very simple.
      Each tile should measure forty by forty pixels.  You need to
      provide a graphic image that contains at least 3 rows of 40
      pixels each (for the three different tile colors) and a variable
      number of frames to do your animation (this animation will be
      shown when the mouse cursor is over a cluster of tiles of the
      same color).</para>

      <para>To allow Same-GNOME to pick up your tile set you need to
      install this on the $prefix/pixmaps/same-gnome directory (where
      $prefix stands for the installation prefix used to configure the
      GNOME environment, you can find this out by running the command
      <symbol>gnome-config --prefix</symbol>).</para>
