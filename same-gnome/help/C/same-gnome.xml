<!-- The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: -->

<!-- * the first component of the revision number reflects the release version of the GNOME desktop. -->
<!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->
<!-- For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the manual that -->
<!-- is written in that desktop timeframe is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc. -->
<!-- When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision number of the manual changes -->
<!-- to V3.0, and so on. -->

<!-- ============= Document Body ============================= -->
<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->

  <sect1 id="introduction"> 
    <title>Playing &app;</title> 
    <para>&app; is a puzzle game. The goal is to remove as many objects as possible in as few moves as possible. Objects that are adjacent to each other get removed as a group, then the remaining objects collapse to fill in the gaps and make new groups. You can't remove single objects.</para>

    <para>The board starts as a full grid of objects. Depending on the size of board you select, there are either three or four types of object. If a group of objects are adjacent and all the same type, then they can be removed simply by clicking them with the mouse (or by pressing the space bar). The objects in a group will start spinning when the mouse moves over them. The number of objects, and the points you will score for removing that group, is shown in the lower left corner of the window.  The more objects in the group, the more points you score. Once the group has been removed the objects above them fall down to fill the space. If an entire column is cleared then the objects slide leftward to fill the gap.</para>

    <para>Scoring is based on the number of objects you delete:</para>
    <table frame="topbot" align="center">
    <tgroup cols="2" align="center">
    <thead><row>
    <entry>Number of Objects</entry>
    <entry>Points Scored</entry>
    </row></thead>
    <tbody>
    <row><entry>2</entry><entry>0</entry></row>

    <row><entry>9</entry><entry>49</entry></row>
    </tbody>
    </tgroup>
    </table>
    <para>For larger numbers the formula is
    <inlineequation>p = (n - 2)<superscript>2</superscript></inlineequation>, where n is the number of objects and p the points scored.
    </para>
    <para>If you clear all the objects there is a 1000 point bonus.</para>

<!-- =========== Getting Started ============================== -->
<!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
     to start the application and to describe the user interface components
     of the application. If there is other information that it is important
     for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
     also include this information here. 
     If the information about how to get started is very short, you can 
     include it in the Introduction and omit this section. -->

  <sect1 id="same-gnome-customisation">
    <title>Customization</title>

    <para>You can alter the look of the game and the size of the
  board. The former is done via the view menu and the later via the size
  menu.</para>

    <sect2 id="changing-the-size">
      <title>Changing the Size</title>
      <para>The <guimenuitem>Size</guimenuitem> menu contains three settings: small, medium and large. Aside from increasing the number of objects, the large setting also increases the number of different objects.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="changing-the-look">
      <title>Changing the Look</title>
      <para>You can change the look of the objects by using the <guimenuitem>Theme</guimenuitem> item in the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu. You are presented with a list of the available styles.</para>
      <para>To change the size of the individual objects, resize the window. To make the maximum use of the screen, choose the <guimenuitem>Fullscreen</guimenuitem> option from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.</para>
        <para>You can create your own themes. Use an existing theme as a template and put the result in <filename>$XDG_DATA_HOME/gnome-games/same-gnome/themes/2.10/</filename>. It will be automatically included on the themes list next time you run &app;. <filename>$XDG_DATA_HOME</filename> is usually <filename>~/.local/share/</filename>.</para>
