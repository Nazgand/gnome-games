 <chapter id="description"><title>Description</title>
  <para>
	 A very simple Turing Machine simulator. If you want to know more about
	 Turing Machines, check this
	 <ulink URL="http://obiwan.uvi.edu/computing/turing/ture.htm">Turing Machine
	 Introduction</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	 This is a very intuitive program. It has four main buttons for resetting,
	 stopping, playing and playing the machine by steps. When a program is
	 load into the simulator, the user is given with indications of the format
	 of the tape for that specific program, and it is possible to launch a
	 States Viewer to see, and even debug, any program that is ran. A
	 specification of the program file format is given as well in this
	 document. Please send any programs you produce to Arturo Espinosa so that
	 they are included in the next release.
  </para>
	<para>
	 The Turing Machine simulated by this program allows to read any kind of
   available character, but does not have a way to express "else", so
   programs that contemplate a large space of input may increase very easily.
	</para>
 </chapter>
   
 <chapter id="display"><title>The Display</title>
   <para>
	  Very typical controls for this applications will be found when launched:
		a menu bar, a toolbar the main application display and a status display.
		The status display shows at the left the name of the program file that
		is currently loaded and the current state at the right.
	 </para>
	 <para>
	  The main application display shows the contents of the machine's tape
		and the position of the machine's read/write head, denoted by a
		cyrcumflex accent (^). The display will animate as the machine runs
		its program or the user presses the "Step" button in the toolbar.
   </para>
  <sect1 id="menubar"><title>The Menu Bar</title>
   <para>
	  The "File" menu lets you load a program into the machine and exit the
		application. You will have to choose a previously editted file when
		loading a program. The examples directory will be open the first time
		you choose this option.
	 </para>
	 <para>
	  Set the tape's contents and the speed at which the machine will run with
		the "Options" menu. There is an option to activate or deactivate the
		States View here. Changing the tape's contents will reset the machine.
	 </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="toolbar"><title>The Toolbar</title>
   <para>
	  The toolbar is the central control for gTuring. It provides you with four
		buttons for operating the machine. Each button gets activated or 
		deactivated depending on the execution status of the machine, showing you
		your options at the moment.
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Reset: Sets the machine at state 0 and puts the tape's contents
      as it was originaly entered by the user. The machine's head is set at
		  the leftmost character of the tape.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Stop: Pauses the machine.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Run: The machine starts transitioning from one state to the next,
      according to the states that have been previously loaded in it. The
			speed at which the transitions are executed is set in the "Options"
			menu.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Step: Execute only one transition.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="dialogs"><title>States View</title>
   <para>
	  The States View lets the user see the whole states table of the Turing
		Machine through a column list. The state at which the machine is will be
		the underlined row. As the machines goes from one transition to the other,
		the underlined row will change to reflect the state that is just about to
		be executed.
