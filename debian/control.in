 As the README puts it:
 .
 Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin,
 and someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people
 running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with
 Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular
 operating system. Your objective is to click the mouse on them,
 ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a
 computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the
 virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with
 your vital software.  The game ends when only 0 or 1 of your
 computers is being productive.  Additionally, some computers are
 connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes
 infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the
 computer on the other end when it reaches there.
