2005-07-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c (network_game_dialog_show): Change the
	initial status message to be a little less clunky.

2005-07-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* libgnomegames.schemas.in: players -> player's. Spotted by Clytie
	Siddall.

2005-07-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Insert the correct file list for the
	schemas. Add schema_DATA to DISTCLEANFILES. This should fix a
	"make distcheck" problem.

2005-07-08  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.[c|h]: Fix for warnings related to buffer signedness.

2005-07-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am
	* games-scores.c:
	* games-scores.h:
	* games-score.c:
	* games-score.h:
	* games-scores-backend.c:
	* games-scores-backend.h:
	* games-scores.gob: Ditch gob for games-scores*, create pure C
	versions of everything. It even compiles now. Nothing useful
	happens though.

2005-07-07  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-scores.[c|h]:
	* games-scores-private.h: Add to CVS. These are from a prior
	games-scores.gob
	* Makefile.am: Try to skip doing anything the the games-scores.gob
	temporarily.

2005-06-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores.gob: I'm stuck in Changi Airport and I can only
	find the brain-power to clean up warnings.

	* Makefile.am (GOB_FILES): Rearrange the names so the dependencies
	work out right.

2005-06-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores.gob: The first games-scores code. It doesn't work
	yet, but it does compile. DO NOT USE, it was just simpler to fix
	an accident by uploading it.

	* games-network.c (games_host_lan_game): Patch from Sven Herzberg
	to replace snprintf with g_strdup_printf.

2005-06-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Added the GPL at the top of the file.

2005-06-23  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_new_from_file): Ensure that the
	pixbuf loader is closed prior to setting our rendering path. 

2005-06-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c: Massive UI reorganisation. The
	preferences have now been folded into the main window. As a
	side-effect this fixes the bug where you had to visit the
	preferences window before "Connect" would do anything. The status
	text box has been reduced to a single line that indicates what we
	are trying to do right now. Errors should appear as dialogs (I
	haven't fixed everything coming from the non-GUI side yet). Don't
	mistake this for the last word in GUI design either - it is merely
	better, not good.

2005-05-31  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_prepare_for_statusbar_tooltips) 
	(connect_proxy, unset_statusbar_tooltip, set_statusbar_tooltip):
	Imported a few functions that handle menu tooltips and statusbars.

2005-05-28  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_copy_tooltip_from_stockid):
	Takes a stockid, and sends back a copy of a nice tooltip string.

2005-05-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Split the button setting routine out
	from the initialiser and give it its own function. This results in
	nicer code.
	Oops: make _set_message handle NULL strings properly.

2005-05-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Add a message area to the dialog. Use
	games_scores_dialog_set_message. Also add an extra option to _new
	to set the button types.

2005-05-04  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-card-pixmaps.c (games_card_pixmaps_get_red_joker): 
	Specify the correct card. This only affected Aisleriot Thieves.

2005-04-24  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Handle the case when no categories are
	defined. i.e. games with only one level.

2005-04-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-controls.c: Don't leak a gconf client reference when
	errors occur.

2005-04-04  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_items): i18n notes.

2005-04-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Port Dennis' UI fixes back to the gob
	fiile and repack the vbox so that it works as expected by
	same-gnome et. al.

2005-03-31  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.c (games_stock_items): Remove ellipsis for the menuitem "Scores",
	since it does not require further input from the user prior to doing something. 
	Also, try using "New", "Pause" and "Restart" without appending the word "Game".

2005-03-30  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-stock.h:
	* games-stock.c: New files to support games-stock menu items.
	Call games_stock_init () prior to using the items.

2005-03-23  Dennis Cranston  <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>
 
 	* gnome-scores-dialog.c: Make the scores dialog more HIG compliant.
 	
2005-03-23  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-gridframe.h:
	* games-gridframe.c: Alignment support added throughout.
	games_grid_frame_set_alignment): New function.

2005-03-23  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c: A patch from Dennis Cranston
	<dennis_cranston@yahoo.com> to make the network game dialog a lot,
	lot, less ugly.

	* games-frame.c: 	
	* games-frame.h: A patch from Dennis Cranston
	<dennis_cranston@yahoo.com> to convert games-frame to be what is
	essentially gimp-frame. This makes it a far nicer widget and lets
	the labels on vertically stacked frames align correctly..

2005-02-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Patch from Nickolay V. Shmyrev to get
	translation of the high-scores dialog working properly. See bug
	#167175.

2005-01-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-files.c: Remove duplicates from the returned lists. This
	includes removing duplicates after the names are transformed. If
	it were a general API I might be worried about this behaviour, but
	this is almost always what we want in our case.

2005-01-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Move the widgets in the vbox from the
	start to the end to make it easier to add a label at the
	beginning.

2005-01-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am:
	* games-scores-dialog.gob: Creat a new widget for handling the
	display of scores. It is based on the scores dialog from
	gnomine (which has since been converted to use this).

2005-01-03  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_new_from_uri): Removed. 

2004-11-15  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* games-network-dialog.c:
	* games-gridframe.c:
	* games-gconf.c:
	* games-card-selector.c: Don't use gnome.h or bonobo-i18n.h.

	* games-preimage.[ch] (games_preimage_new_from_file):
	* games-card-images.c (games_card_images_prerender): API change so
	make it clear that we don't depend on gnome-vfs.

2004-12-16  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-controls.c: Disable list->view search.

2004-12-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask_for_colormap.

	* games-card-images.c:
	* games-card-pixmaps.c: In range checks, return NULL if fail.

2004-11-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-card-images.c:
	* games-card-pixmaps.c:	
	* games-card-pixamps.h: Remove the duplicate definition of
	GAMES_CARD_ID and add some range checks for a cardids and the
	like.

2004-11-21  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-card-images.h, games-card-pixmaps.h (GAMES_CARD_ID):
	Support for ace-high decks. (#158899, Harry Ray)

2004-11-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network.c: Fix conflicting extern and static
	declarations. Fixes bug #158624 (compilation on AIX).

2004-11-08  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.h: Move G_BEGIN_DECLS below #include glib.h
	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_render): scale pixbufs using
	GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR rather than GDK_INTERP_HYPER... Better overall
	image quality meant off-center tiled images with unclean edges.

2004-11-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* libgnomegames.schemas.in: Fix closing tag.

2004-11-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network-dialog.c (config_cb): Make the local networking
	options insensitive if we don't have libhowl available.

	* games-network.c: Made support for libhowl optional at
	compile-time. Search for NO_HOWL for the details.	
	(games_start_server): Removed the altternative paths to
	games-server.py. They are only usefil for developers who are quite
	capable of setting PATH for themselves.

2004-10-04  Andreas Røsdal <andrearo@stud.ntnu.no>

	* Makefile.am: Install games-server in bin directory.
	* games-network-dialog.[c|h]: Implement GUI support for howl.
	* games-network.[c|h]: Implement howl support for discovering. 
	Implement support for starting the games-server.

	* games-card-images.c: Revert Richard's last patch since it
	conflicts with his previous patch.

2004-09-20  Andreas Røsdal <andrearo stud ntnu no>

	* games-network.c: Use callback functions to handle the function
	calls from the network layer to the game. Also add the
	function games_send_gamedata (), which makes the network
	code more generalized.
	* games-network-dialog.c: Use callback functions, and
	disable the "Connect" button when no game can be started.
	* games-server.py: Add support for gnibbles.

2004-09-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-gridframe.h:
	* games-gridframe.c: Add code to allow for a "padding" in the
	frame so you can have space to do things like, say, draw the

	Tweaked the alpha bi-level threshold to make the cards look
	better. Not perfect, but in the absence of true alpha-blending
	fairly nice.

2004-07-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	widget.

2004-05-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	think I'm doing the dispose/finalize stuff wrong though.

2004-05-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-files.c: Fix warnings.

2004-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): How about we actually distribute
	games-card-commons.h ?

2004-05-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-card-images.c: Render individual cards on demand rather
	than all at once.

2004-05-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>
