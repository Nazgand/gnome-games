2004-11-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network.c: Fix conflicting extern and static
	declarations. Fixes bug #158624 (compilation on AIX).

2004-11-08  Richard Hoelscher  <rah@rahga.com>

	* games-preimage.h: Move G_BEGIN_DECLS below #include glib.h
	* games-preimage.c (games_preimage_render): scale pixbufs using
	GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR rather than GDK_INTERP_HYPER... Better overall
	image quality meant off-center tiled images with unclean edges.

2004-11-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* libgnomegames.schemas.in: Fix closing tag.

2004-11-01  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* games-network.c: Made support for libhowl optional at
	compile-time. Search for NO_HOWL for the details.	
	(games_start_server): Removed the altternative paths to
	games-server.py. They are only usefil for developers who are quite
	capable of setting PATH for themselves.

2004-10-04  Andreas Røsdal <andrearo@stud.ntnu.no>

	* Makefile.am: Install games-server in bin directory.

2004-09-20  Andreas Røsdal <andrearo stud ntnu no>

	* games-network.c: Use callback functions to handle the function
	calls from the network layer to the game. Also add the
	function games_send_gamedata (), which makes the network
	code more generalized.
	* games-network-dialog.c: Use callback functions, and
	disable the "Connect" button when no game can be started.

	better. Not perfect, but in the absence of true alpha-blending
	fairly nice.

2004-07-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	widget.
