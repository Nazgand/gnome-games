    <para>
      You play a little guy who is trapped in a cave, you must move around the
      cave tunelling through the ground looking for the exit. As you tunnel you
      have to collect the gemstones (diamonds to be precise) and avoid being
      squashed by falling rocks. In some levels, your task is to move
      strategically placed boxes into 'holes'.

       A set of levels to play can be selected from the
       <guimenuitem>Game</guimenuitem> tab in the <link
       linkend="prefs"><interface>Preferences</interface></link>
       dialog.  There are two basic game modes: <link
       linkend="gnomekoban">Sokoban</link>, the block sliding game, or
       the <link linkend="cavegame">Cave Escape</link> game. Each
       level set is played in one of these modes.

   <title>Cave game</title> 
   <para> 
     You are in a cave full of rocks, diamonds and dirt. Your goal is
   to dig through the dirt and collect enough diamonds to open a
   hidden exit from the cave. In your way are the boulders. You can
   push a single boulder, if there is nothing behind it. You can also
   dig under a boulder, but beware, if there is nothing to support a
   boulder it will fall and could squash you. Being squashed by a
   boulder is invariably fatal..
   </para>
   <para>
   To dig through the dirt, just move through it. Similarly if you
   want to push a rock move up to it and keep moving against it. To
   pick up a diamond move over it. If you want to be killed by one of
   the creatures that also roam the caves, just run into it (or let it
   run into you). You get the idea.
</para>
      <para>
   Once you have collected enough diamonds there will be a flash and a
   flashing doorway will appear somewhere on the level, find it and
   get out of the cave before time runs out. The quicker you finish
   the level, the higher your score.
   </para>
   <para>
   It is obviously a good idea not to die. You only have a small
   number of lives and once you use them all up the game is
   over. Also, if you die you must restart the level. There are many
   ways to die, the most common one is to be under a falling object
   when it lands. You will undoubtedly discover the others. Be warned
   that the using the <guimenuitem>Restart level</guimenuitem> menu
   item costs you a life.

   In this version of the game your task is to move strategically
   placed crates or blocks into holes (hollow red squares), you move
   the crates in a similar way to rocks except there is no gravity
   acting in this environment. Once you have slid all your blocks into
   the required positions you move onto the next level. Nothing will
   fall on you or try and hunt you down in this game, but you are up
   against the clock in this game.
