This is an unsorted list of things to do:

* Add joystick support.  Will be done, if I get a joystick to play with.
* Make objects in the game files bigger than one ascii character.
* Revisit the printing of messages during the game play.
* Add signals to GStonesObject definitions.
* Make GStonesObjects loadable.
* Draw nicer graphics. 
* Add more caves and games to the game.
* Extract GStonesObject stuff from the cave.[ch] files.
* Write Help and README files.
