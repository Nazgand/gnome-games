	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Fix the high-score file
	installation (thanks Steve).

	* mahjongg.c: Moved the seed to the title bar to be consistent
	with other games (bug #114996). Also made the menu items
	(esp. undo redo) context sensitive. The menu and the toolbar now
	also match each other.

	* bg4.png: Darkened up the border when highlighted so that there
	is a distinct difference between selected and unselected.

2003-06-26  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: More work on the new code. Everything is
	theoretically in place, but naturally it doesn't work. However it
	does spell dependency correctly.

2003-06-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* solubility.c: Started work on a cleaner new game routine. It is
	really only lacking in it's handling of the dependencies. The code
	is currently #ifdefed out.

	again, in about the third app in a row.

2003-06-22  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c (main): Doh, change the gconf key in the code too.

2003-06-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.schemas.in: Change the schema to be consistent and
	legal. 

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Remove bash specific shell
	code (for FreeBSD).

2003-06-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Only install schemas
	if they are requested.

2003-05-31  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Implement setgid modifications
	(see gnome-games/ChangeLog). Also undo the score directory
	changes. It breaks more than it fixes.
	

2003-05-30  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (scoredir): Changed score directory to fix bug
	#113968.

2003-05-29  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c (about_callback): Correct about dialog behaviour.

2003-05-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: Made sure we can't have multiple score dialogs (bug

2003-05-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* mahjongg.c: i18n fixups. Created the bold_frame convenience

2002-07-04  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* mahjongg.c: Created a new function gconf_sanity_check() which
	checks that a known key is valid. If this looks good, I'll add it
	to all of the GConf-based games. (yes, I am getting lots of bugs
	which end up as "the schemas are not installed")

	  up the help doc okay, but we should change the call
	  to list Help with the pretty logo instead of just
	  listing 'mahjong'.  We also need to hook up a Help
	  button in the preferences dialog.  I have to run
	  now, so this will have to wait until later.

	various stylistic fixups.
	Renumbered and named game_state enumeration to help debugging.
	chain on to (exit_game_callback_query): correct 3 arg. function

1999-07-11  Rosanna Yuen <rwsy@mit.edu>

	* default.png: reversed the fortune character so that it isn't
	backwards anymore.
	
1999-07-08  Michael Meeks  <michael@edenproject.org>

	* mahjongg.c: Added <ctrl> H hint shortcut key.

1999-06-20  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: add the new file (bg4.png) so it gets installed
	* bg1.png bg2.png bg3.png bg4.png: Changed the backgrounds a bit
	(added 2 new ones)

1999-04-17  Francisco Bustamante  <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* mahjongg.c: Now it is possible to change the background of the
	tiles without changing the images on the tiles. At the same time I
	added the option to have different tile backgrounds for each
	layer, to make it easier to distinguish between them. The
	background can be changed in the preferences dialog (also added)
	* bg[123].png: Some backgrounds to show the new capabilities.

Tue Apr  6 10:45:22 1999  ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* mahjongg.c: use g_strcasecmp instead of strcasecmp.

1999-02-09  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* mahjongg.c: Removed evil gtk_widget_realize call..

1999-02-07  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* mahjongg.c: Realize the main window and fvwm gets happier...

1999-01-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* mahjongg.c (load_tiles): Warn the user in the GUI, not with a printf.
	Kill file menu too.

1999-01-10  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

 	message.

	Standardized the menus.

1999-01-08  Callum McKenzie <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	changed the use of the "selected" field in tile to make
	sure that hints and selection interacted nicely.

	* mahjongg.c (main): now use the new toolbar code.

1998-12-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	instead of gnome_canvas_set_size().

1998-11-19  Francisco Bustamante <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* mahjongg.c: Changing the map works now. Memory leaking is
	greatly reduced because images are destroyed after use. Changed
	gnome_dialog_set_modal (or whatever) to
	gtk_window_set_modal. Changing the tile images works
	too. Compiling warnings are gone. Most warnings during the game
	are gone too. Upped version to 0.99.1
	
1998-11-15  Francisco Bustamante <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* mahjongg.c: All the tile drawing is now done by
	gnome-canvas. The code is somewhat cleaner, and the redraws are
	definitely better. TODO: make changing map and changing tile
	images work. When you use gnome_canvas_item_set to change the
	image, do we need to destroy the old image? Version 0.99.0
	* default.png: Someone did something to the transparent parts of
	the image, so I put them again. This is to make tiles nicer.
	
1998-11-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* mahjongg.c: Calculate x and y offsets to place tiles in the
	center of the playfield (AREA_WIDTH x AREA_HEIGHT).  Calculate new 
	values every time the map changes.

1998-26-28  Erik Troan  <ewt@redhat.com>

	* mahjongg.c: use gnome_color_picker instead of gnome_color_selector

	tileset without starting a new game.
	
Mon May 11 21:05:50 EDT 1998  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@mit.edu>
	* default.xpm:  Was less brain-dead and changed the highlighted dragon
	to face the correct way as well... (:
