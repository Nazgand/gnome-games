<title>Notes</title>
<p>Notes, or pencilmarks, can be added to any cell. They allow you to mark possible values for a cell, or store other data that might help you. Notes will store all characters in order, but will remove repetitions of characters.</p> <comment>Other wordings I considered were 'repeated instances of characters', but I wanted to communicate it would leave the first one. If you can come up with something better, by all means, change it.</comment>
<p>To add notes to a cell:</p>
<steps>
	<item><p>Select the cell</p></item>
	<item><p>Click on the part of a cell that is above the line that appears when you hover over it. Alternatively, type <key>N</key>.</p></item>
	<item><p>Type your notes</p></item>
	<item><p>Press <key>Enter</key> or click outside of the text box.</p></item>
</steps>
<note><p>You can also take notes in the bottom of the cell by clicking in the bottom of the cell or by typing <key>M</key>. However, this area is used when you click <link xref="hints">Show All Possible Numbers</link>. If you plan to use this area, you should not use Show All Possible Numbers.</p></note>
<note><p>You can add a number to the notes at the top of the square by typing <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>1</key></keyseq> through <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>9</key></keyseq></p></note>
