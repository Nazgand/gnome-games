	* src/lib/game_selector.py Make sure one game is always selected for restoring (Bug #422748)

2007-03-25  Robert Ancell <robert.ancell@gmail.com>

	* Use string substitution using dictionary lookups when using ngettext to stop
	  substitution exceptions (Bug #409739)
	* src/lib/game_selector.py Handle corrupted high score entries (Bug #413848)
	* Removed dialog separators to be HIG compliant
	* src/lib/gsudoku.py Stop number pop-up from visibly moving when created
	* src/lib/gsudoku.py Stop number pop-up from being in taskbar list (Bug #406767)
	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Change title name from 'Gnome Sudoku' to 'Sudoku' (Bug #410433)

2007-03-24  Robert Ancell <robert.ancell@gmail.com>

	* src/lib/sudoku_maker.py Correctly mark game name as unicode so
	  can be split on character boundaries (Bug #409740)

2007-03-16  Robert Ancell <robert.ancell@gmail.com>

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py Load random module (Bug #411073).
	* src/lib/game_selector.py Fix PyGtk tree selection bug (Bug #416063)
       	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Fix undo tracker deletion (Bug #417805)
	* src/lib/sudoku_maker.py Handle exceptions loading pickled objects (Bug #408837)

2007-02-25  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/game_selector.py Fix display of games that were printed
	and "marked as played" in resume-game dialog.
	* src/lib/timer.py Handle games that don't have proper
	__absolute_start_time__ set gracefully. This is to account for
	games that are printed and marked-as-played, which don't have any
	timer information when they are restored. As a result, we put a
	check into toggle_timing which resets the timer if there is no
	__absolute_start_time__ set.
	* src/lib/saver.py Handle saved games with no tracker information
	(this is to make restoring printed games that were
	marked-as-played workable).
	* src/lib/gsudoku.py Handle games without any in_progress
	information saved. This is to handle restoring games that were
	marked-as-played. This fixes Bug 408787 - crash in Sudoku:
	ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack.
	
2007-02-25  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py: Fix bug #409472 crash in Sudoku: pressed
	Clear on one of....  This was caused by a bug in
	entry_validate. We've now simplified the find_error routine that
	entry_validate calls so that it will never return None (which
	caused the key error). We also fix a typo in
	SudokuGameDisplay.remove that was causing errors to get
	un-highlighted when they should not be (this error could also have
	caused some bugs in which the game the user sees would not be
	reflected in gnome-sudoku's internal grid, resulting in finished
	games that were not considered finished by gnome-sudoku).
 
	* src/lib/sudoku.py: Change find_conflict method to
	find_conflicts, which will return all conflicts. This fixes bug
	#409472 and also assures we will highlight all conflicts. 

2007-02-25  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py: Fix bug #400976 "Sudoku crashes on
	logout with a TypeError exception". We fix this two ways -- first,
	insensitize the clear buttons so that we won't get the clear_cb
	called if there are no trackers selected. Second, add a check to
	clear_cb so that it doesn't give a traceback if for some reason it
	is called with no trackers selected.

2007-02-22  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/sudoku.py: Fix bug #409878 "crash in Sudoku:
	clicked on the Fill button", which would raise an exception
	when the fill button is clicked multiple times.

2007-02-16  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py: do not make menu titles insensitive,
	but the menu items instead. This complies with the HIG guidelines.
	Patch from Mariano Suárez-Alvarez in Bug #408439.  

2007-02-16  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py: Check that a txt object isn't NoneType,
	which causes a crash when removing the A/C charger (!!!!).
	Patch from Thomas Andersen in Bug #408334.

2007-02-03  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py: Mark two strings for translation Bug #402870.

2007-01-27  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/defaults.py.in: Resolve Bug #393882: strings not translated. 
	This is done by specifying the locale directory specifically.

2007-01-27  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py: Prevent exception from occuring when
	clicking on the autofill button, when nothing is selected.
	Closes Bug #400279.

2007-01-15  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Wrap methods that bring up a "swallowed
	dialog" (New Game, etc.) with a decorator that inactivates widgets
	that would lead to a confused state for gnome sudoku (e.g. don't
	allow the user to go two levels deep into "New Game" dialogs,
	don't allow them to "print" a game that isn't visible, etc.). This
	fixes bug #392997.

	Clear history when starting new game or opening game (#388744)
	
	* src/lib/gtk_goodies/Undo.py Add clear() method to undo history
	list.

2007-01-15  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Use new add_value_to_ui method for
	inserting values in squares on an "undo" of clearing the
	grid. This method will re-insert values whether or not they were
	valid parts of the grid.

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py When clearing the grid, clear all
	user-entered values, whether or not they are part of our internal
	grid (or internal grid doesn't stores values that were invalid
	when entered). Add new add_value_to_ui convenience method for
	adding a value to the entry whether or not its valid. Use
	entry_validate to add previously-conflicting values to our
	internal grid when the conflicting value is deleted; this gives us
	error handling for free in case other conflicts arise (should fix
	bug #396823).
	
2007-01-07  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gnome-sudoku.desktop.in: Add missing bugzilla stuff.

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* glade/puzzle_generator.glade: Change shortcuts in gnome-sudoku:
	Set alt+v to "Very hard" and alt+u to "Generate new puzzles until
	stopped". Patch from Thomas Andersen in Bug #392172.

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/sudoku_generator_gui.py: Add a temporary solution
	to the puzzle generator generating more puzzles than asked,
	so that the bug is not visible to the user. This will be fixed 
	"the correct way" during the 2.19.x development cycle. Patch 
	from Thomas Andersen in Bug #392165. 

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/sudoku_generator_gui.py: Fix three issues with the 
	progress bar in the puzzle generator. Patch from Thomas Andersen 
	in Bug #392616.

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/sudoku_generator_gui.py: Disable generate options while
	the puzzle generator is running (Bug #392947).

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/dialog_swallower.py: Correct Bug #384684: Crash when 
	closing game with "x", which was caused by reading data from
	memory which had already been freed by the garbage collection. 

2006-12-29  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

2006-11-04  Thomas M. Hinkle  <Thomas_Hinkle@alumni.brown.edu>

	* images/footprints.png: Used shoe-prints. Note that if we get a
	real artist to pretty up this icon, it needs to contain mostly
	solid black that will gets properly re-colored when we add
	trackers of different colors.
	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py: Tweak our fix to Bug 369531; Use
	STOCK_DIALOG_INFO instead of STOCK_INFO for hints. Make sure
	tracker is off by default.
	* src/lib/gsudoku.py: Change colors for trackers to tango-y colors.	
	* src/lib/gtk_goodies/image_extras.py: Fix re-coloring of black png files.
	* src/lib/saver.py: Don't automatically show trackers just because
	there *are* trackers for a game; rely on the UI to save the
	toggled-state of tracker visibility on its own.
