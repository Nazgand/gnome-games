gnome-games "It's For Your Own Good" 2.3.6
==========================================

This release is in theory a good facsimile of what 2.4.0 will look
like. The most obvious change will be that the documentation is now
mostly up-to-date. 

All games should now have state-sensitive undo and redo buttons as
well as full keyboard navigation for the preferences.

The bug count is now about a third of what it was at the start of the
2.3 series.

Changes by game:

Gtali:
  - Several dead options have been removed (or hidden as gconf keys).
  - Undo doesn't corrupt the display.

Gnotravex:
  - Resizing code now works a bit better.

Aisleriot:
 - If you play spider then there is a subtle change: to finish the
   game you have to move the completed piles up to the
   foundation. This is now consistent with other games.

Gnome-stones:
 - The joystick dialog actually works now, although since I don't have
   a joystick I have no idea if any of the joystick code actually works.

Gataxx:
 - The animation code actually does the right thing now. This is only
   noticeable if using "partial" animation.

Gnomine:
 - It compiles with gcc 2.96 again.
 - We now don't read all the pixmaps each time we recieve an expose
   event. Oops.

Gnobots:
 - Be a bit more graceful about failing to find configuration files.
 

gnome-games "Palm Cove" 2.3.5
=============================

This release is a little early since I'm going to be away during the
"official" release period. My location will of course be a closely
guarded secret.

There is but one major change, most of the names have changed ! This
hasn't been done to protect the innocent, or event the particularly
guilty. Instead it is an attempt to get rid of GNOME-this and
GNOME-that in the menus (as per the HIG). So "GNOME Robots" has become
"Robots" and "GTali" has become "Tali". This change only affects the menus.

The down side of this is that "glines" has become "Lines" and
"GNOME-Stones" has become "Stones". Anyone who has a better idea can
post suggestions under bug #117191 in Bugzilla.

Gnometris stays as Gnometris because it's really hard to avoid the
trade-marked "Tetris" and still be descriptive.

The other user-visible change is that the gnomine (sorry, "Mines")
window is now completely resizable and the size of the individual
tiles follows the size of the window (the numbers and icons scale
too). The explicit "mine size" item in the preferences dialog is
gone.

There were also some minor fixes, some of them very embarrassing to
the maintainer.

gnome-games "Cruising Along" 2.3.4
==================================

Things are cruising along towards a nice, stable, 2.4 release.
This release mostly contains bug fixes and clean-ups. 

A big thanks goes to Jon McCann and Steve Chaplin who have done most
of the work on this release.

The TODO file now has a complete list of what we hope to complete for
2.4 and an incomplete list of what is planned for 2.5 and beyond.

Be warned that changes involving gconf mean that some preferences will
be lost. Selecting the correct preferences again will fix this. We
apologise for the inconvenience, but the change-over from gnome-config
to gconf had already been delayed way too long for some games.

This is still an unstable release, but it should be more stable than
2.2 and testing is badly needed. In particular gnobots2 and mahjongg
have produced a number of crashes which aren't reproducible on the
maintainers machines. Stack traces or precise instructions on how to
reproduce them (including OS version, library versions, etc.) are
desparately needed to try and track these down.

All games have improved HIG compliance and most menus are now context
sensitive, e.g. you can't select undo if no move has been made.

AisleRiot:
 The help files work with yelp (even the broken versions).
 There should be better compatibility with Red Hat 9's guile.

Glines:
 The background is now a solid colour and the grid lines are thinner.

Gnome-stones:
 New opening title that should be i18n compatible now.

Gnotravex:
 The game is now resizable, try it, we hope to make most games like
 this in 2.5.


gnome-games "Shiny Things Revenge" 2.3.3
========================================

13% Fewer bugs, 15% less fat and 7% more games.

We now have a blackjack game courtesy of Jon McCann.

The package has also lost 1.5 Mb due to the judicious use of jpeg
compression.

For the paranoid system administrator there are now the
--disable-setgid, --with-scores-group and --with-scores-user options
for configure to help you manage those pesky setgid binaries.

The major changes, game by game:

aisleriot:
 * Should stop crashing if you have libguile >1.5.
 * More i18n work. Still not perfect, but should be a lot better.

gataxx:
 * The corruption when using the undo button has been fixed.
 * Don't crash after 128 turns.
 * Gataxx is now bug-free (TM).

gdk-card-image:
 * Some extra card images. Look for the "Dondorf" images.

gnome-stones:
 * There are now some sokoban levels to play. Thanks go to Alberto
   Manuel Brandao Simoes for convering the levels from Herman
   Mansilla's Yakoban game. Select the Gnomekoban levels from the
   preferences dialog and don't forget about the "restart level"
   option when you back youself into a corner.
 * There has been no real chance for play-testing these levels yet
   against the current sokoban implementation, if you have any
   suggestions to make feel free to file a report in bugzilla (even if
   it isn't technically a bug).

gnometris:
 * "Paused" and "Game over" messages.
 * Key behaviour fixes when a new piece appears.
 * Scoring consistency: dropping the blocks now scores as much as
   using fast-fall with the down arrow. 
 * Big PNG backgrounds converted to jpeg. The transition should happen
   automatically and not be noticeable.

mahjongg:
 * The multiple score dialogs problem might have been fixed this time.

Lots of fixes for behaviour and i18n all over the place, thanks should
especially go to Steve Chaplin and Christian Rose for their patience
in making sure I did things properly.

gnome-games "The Freecell Players Will Lynch Me" 2.3.2
======================================================

There have been some major changes with gnome-games. Gnobots2 and
Gnibbles are back, but Freecell has been removed. There are also 30%
fewer bugs than in 2.3.1.

Freecell addicts shouldn't panic: there is still a Freecell icon.
It links directly to the AisleRiot version of freecell. There are two
features that are known to be missing:
 1) There is no score dialog. If there is demand I will write a new
    one for AisleRiot.
 2) The translations will be marginally worse. AisleRiot has some 
    "interesting" issues regarding scheme and gettext. The fundamental 
    problem has been resolved, but none of the issues it caused have
    been fixed yet, this will happen in 2.3.3.
If any other favourite feature of freecell is missing, file a bug report.

The source for xbill and freecell are still available in the CVS
module gnome-games-deprecated. They are not currently buildable. Xbill
is also available (in a usable form) at www.xbill.org.

Here are the major changes:

aisleriot: 
        Gettext is now called from within scheme. There is no real
        change yet, but we should be able to improve the
        translations in the future.
        If --variation is used then it is only applied to that
        instance of the program.
 
gataxx: 
        It actually works now. At least we know the sanity checks
        work, pity the schema wasn't sane.

gdk-card-image: 
        The library has been moved to its own directory. Build
        problems on *BSD should now be resolved.

gnome-stones: 
        HIG cleanups.

gnomine:
        Improvements to the contrast between cleared and uncleared
        cells. The window doesn't resize when it looses focus.
        Also added checks to limit the number of mines to the field size.

gnotravex: 
        A tile corruption bug has been fixed. Gnotravex is now bug-free (TM).

gtali:  The binary is now 100k lighter thanks to careful use of
        colour-reduction.

libgames-support: 
        HIG and i18n fixups.

mahjongg:  
        HIG cleanups.

same-gnome: 
        Cleaner preferences dialog.

There has also been an effort to limit the number of dialog boxes
asking "Are you sure ...". This is an ongoing project.


gnome-games "Nothing to See Here" 2.3.1
=======================================

This is mostly bug fixes and not a lot of them. The primary purpose 
of this release is to make sure the new maintainer knows what he's doing.

* GTali behaves itself if you're winning by a gratuitous margin
* Improved GTali documentation.
* Moved the Gnotravex icon down to the shared directory.
* Fixed Same-Gnome sanity check so it actually stops the program crashing.
* Abel Cheung made sure all the ChangeLogs where in UTF-8 and not
  whatever we'd picked up along the way.

Corrupted GConf data is still likely to crash most games, but rampant
GConf misconfiguration should be handled gracefully. Bug reports to
the contrary are welcome.


gnome-games "Fat Camp" 2.3.0
====================

All of the gnome-games 2.2.1 changes:
* Fixed Freecell compile on FreeBSD
* Fixed GNect schemas
* Fixed GNOME Stones GObject usage
* Use Close instead of OK in Gnometris
* Cleaned up Mahjongg .desktop file
* Updated Mahjongg documentation

Plus:
* Removed games I either don't like, no-one uses, or are pointless
  (gnibbles, gnobots2, iagno2, xbill)
* Also removed the Curses port of gtali
* New Undo architecture in Aisleriot (PLEASE TEST) (closes #83517)
* Changed the next-move algorithm in Iagno (PLEASE TEST) (closes #101996)
* Mahjongg UI love -- now has CFM dialogs
* Aisleriot UI love -- the huge New Game menu has gone, useless table
  headers removed, dialogs are layered correctly, etc
* Added some spacing in the Freecell UI. Should make things clearer
* Added a GConf utility library, which gives us lots of sanity checks
  to tell people they can't install programs correctly
* Cool new icons in GNOME Mines from Jimmac


gnome-games "Cake or Death?" 2.2.0
==================================

* Fix "Figure figure" in GNOME Mines documentation
* Rename xBill icon to avoid conflicting with the original xBill
* All games actually have the same version now
* Lots of small memory leaks fixed
* Translations!
