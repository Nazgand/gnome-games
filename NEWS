* Use Close instead of OK in Gnometris

  (gnibbles, gnobots2, iagno2, xbill)
* Also removed the Curses port of gtali

  headers removed, dialogs are layered correctly, etc
* Added some spacing in the Freecell UI. Should make things clearer
* Added a GConf utility library, which gives us lots of sanity checks
  to tell people they can't install programs correctly
* Cool new icons in GNOME Mines from Jimmac

==================================

* Fix "Figure figure" in GNOME Mines documentation

* Translations!

Thanks to the Documentation Team, the Translation Team, the Release
Team. Also to my parents, my girlfriend, my fish -- Sid, Griswold,
Tallulah, and departed Wanda. I love you guys! Thanks to Eddie and
Hactar for being good workstations, without you I'd have had to do
this with an abacus or something. Thanks to my neighbour, Dorothy, for
keeping me happy for days with a picture of when she met the Pope; and
Michele Campeotto for the same with a certain picture. Thanks to the
many people who submitted bug reports and patches, you all know who
you are.

Thanks to the translation and documentation team for their hard work
as went and changed almost every string...

* Yet more translations!
* Aisleriot: when completing a game you have a choice of what to do
* Many games: put the correct file in the tarballs
* The identify crisis of "GNOME" and "Gnome" is now over. Many games
  are slightly renamed in favour of "GNOME".

  size now.
