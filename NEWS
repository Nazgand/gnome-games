gnome-games "Zero Gravitas" 2.5.9
=================================

This is also a release candidate. Naturally there was a
brown-paper-bag bug discovered the day after the last release. This
has been fixed. Also, the credits have been updated and of course
there have been more translations (does the translation team never
sleep ?!).

gnome-games "Sacrificial Victim" 2.5.8
======================================

This is the release candidate for 2.6. In an ideal world there would be
no major bugs in this release. Here in the real world there will be a
brown-paper-bag bug discovered tomorrow. You could be the one to report
it and cause me hideous embarrassment ! Go ahead, you know you want
to.

Since 2.5.7 the only changes have been bug-fixes, documentation
updates and more translations.

gnome-games "Problem Child" 2.5.7
=================================

This is the long-awaited beta for 2.6. As far as I know there are no
bugs that crash any of the the games or make them unplayable. I expect
this to change once you test it and file what you find in
Bugzilla. The documentation is the only thing expected to change
before 2.6.0.

So what is new this time ?

Bug fixes.
Gnometris now has some basic documentation.
There is a new tileset for mahjongg thanks to Gonzalo Odiard.


gnome-games "Limiting Factor" 2.5.6
===================================

This release is for testing. No new features have been added since
2.5.5 but there have been a lot of bugs fixed and there is some
revised code that needs testing. 

*** Now is the time ot file bug reports ! ***

If you see any bugs in this release, report them. It's too late for UI
changes (although they will be considered for 2.7) but anything that
crashes these games needs to be reported. Please try and give a
precise summary of how to reproduce the bug. Getting stack traces in
gnome-games is hard, but worth it (try running the games as the user
that installed them, e.g. root).

What other excuse do you need to play solitaire all day ?

What has changed:

- blackjack caches its calculations better. Now all game types are
cached (you should only see the progress dialog the first time you
play a rule set). Be warned that this can store up to a megabyte of
data in your home directory. Sharing of the cached files will not be
implemented for 2.6.

- gnomine, gnome-stones, gnotravex and gnometris use a new algorithm
(OK, ugly hack) to set the size of their writing. The old way was
doing bad things whith some systems (especially those with a high
dpi).

- The hint menu item in gnomine is now only available when it can be
used.

- In Ailseriot dragging after a double-click works.

- Aisleriot documentation has been updated to mention the statistics
dialog.

- Some old Spanish and Danish documentation for gnobots and gtali has
been updated from the old html format to docbook. The content hasn't
changed, contributions that fix this are welcome.

- gnibbles: key presses are now buffered so that fast turns are
guaranteed to work.

- Various SVG files have been slimmed down (Thanks to Richard
Hoelscher).

And of course it will crash less often. 

gnome-games "The Ends of Invention" 2.5.5
=========================================

This is the feature-freeze release. This should be what 2.6 looks like
minus the bugs.

The major features of this release are:

Aisleriot: Statistics finally work. You saw the UI with the last
release, now you can find out just how many games you've played and
how often you loose.

Glines: Better versions of the SVG Balls theme from Richard
Hoelscher. Also clicking quickly does the expected thing now.

Gnome-stones: The major crash-on-startup bug that I completely
mis-diagnosed in 2.3.x has now been fixed. Really, truly,
definitely. I'm sure of it this time.

Gnomine: SVG graphics (also by Richard Hoelscher) and better rendering
of those same graphics.

Mahjongg: New layouts from Rexford Newbould and Krzysztof Foltman. Be
warned that your choice of layout will be reset to Easy, but since you
will be wanting to try out the new levels it shouldn't matter :).

Plus the usual long list of translations from the dedicated people in
the translation team.

gnome-games "Irregular Apocalypse" 2.5.4
========================================

WARNING: This release is particularly buggy. The most noticeable of
these bugs is that the new statistics dialog in Aisleriot reports
nonsense. This is for the very simple reason that I haven't actually
written the code to calculate the statistics. The dialog is there for
UI review.

Having said that there are many things to enjoy in this release:

Glines: The window is now fully resizeable and there are two new
vector-graphics themes (balls and shapes). Try balls with the window
maximized. The old ball.png theme has been removed on the grounds of
extreme ugliness.

Gnect: The author (Tim Musson) has done an almost complete rewrite of
the code. It is now prettier, smaller, and simpler.

Aisleriot: There is a statistics dialog that can be opened from the
games menu. It will ultimately contain simple statistics on the games
you have played. As I wrote above, it is not complete and is there
only to meet the UI freeze deadline. There is no code to produce the
statistics. The splash screen has been removed as well.

Gnometris: New default theme and background from Graeme Worthy.

Mahjongg: Clicking quickly works now.


gnome-games "Revisionist" 2.5.3.1
=================================

This is a minor release to fix an intltool problem. It also contains
an update to the seahaven game in aisleriot: you can now drag
sequences of cards to the foundations.

gnome-games "The Catastrophe" 2.5.3
===================================

Finally, we know the answer to the question: can you make a
gnome-games release with a kitten balanced on each shoulder ? The
answer is yes.

Mostly miscellaneous stuff. People who use the shuffle option in
mahjongg will be happy.

aisleriot: Double clicking in the games selection menu now works.
blackjack: Text drawing re-write.
glines: Avoid warnings from premature drawing. Improve the use 
	of GamesFileList.
gnibbles: Reworked the exit code to avoid occasional crashes on
	  exit. Fixes for the desktop file.
gnometris: Avoid crashing by only getting the score when a game is 
	   in progress. Avoid warnings by not trying to impose a C 
	   standard on C++ code.
mahjongg: Shuffling is now guaranteed to produce a solvable pile
          (assuming a solution is possible). Undo and redo now are
	  now disabled after a shuffle.
same-gnome: Use GamesFileList for finding the theme files. You can now
 	    write themes in any format supported by gdk-pixbuf.

gdk-card-image: Improve the use of GamesFileList.
libgames-support: Improvements to GamesFileList.


gnome-games "Nervous Energy" 2.5.2
==================================

This release is evenly split between UI changes and back-end code
consolidation.

Code for locating files in gdk-card-image and glines has been merged
into the libgames-support library. More games will take advantage of
this as the (internal) API firms up.

The card selection widget in gdk-card-image has been changed. This
affects aisleriot and blackjack. You no longer select the details of
the card image from seven menus, instead there is one list with a set
of predefined styles. These styles are loaded from an external file
but home directories are not searched yet so custom styles require
root access. If the current style is not on the list it is not
touched, so existing preferences and direct editing of the style using
gconf-editor will work. 

In addition to the gdk-card-image changes aisleriot has also had its
preferences menu renamed to "view". This reflects the fact that the
entries under it only affect the look of the program.

Blackjack has recieved some cleanup work to the UI and some bug fixes.

Mahjongg is in the middle of a rewrite of the shuffling code. The bug
where all the tiles were drawn after a shuffle has been fixed. Also
the "no more moves" dialog now has a "shuffle" option. Unfortunately
this is all still a bit ugly since it is work in progress.

Gnometris has better high score handling. There is no longer a
duplicate score recorded when you start a new game without finishing
the old one. Also the score is recorded if you quit the program
without finishing the game: great for when the boss walks in
unexpectedly.

gnome-games "Trade Surplus" 2.5.1
====================

This is a catch-up release and unfortunately doesn't contain many sexy
new features. The build process is in the middle of a renovation. You
will now need automake 1.7 if you build from CVS or do other
development work. All the *_DISABLE_DEPRECATED macros have been
completely removed, although it should have compiled cleanly with
them.

Other changes:

aisleriot: Freecell now supports super-moves Checks to make sure the
           card images are actually present.

blackjack: The keyboard controls are now documented plus some bug
           fixes and UI improvements.

glines: Should compile with gcc 2.9.x again. The maintainer is
        flagellating himself as you read this.

gnometris: The preview pane is now drawn properly when the preview is
           turned off. Also some UI cleanups.


gnomine: UI rearrangements. Also the number of flags you can place is
         now capped at the number of mines.


gtali: The game can now be completely played from the keyboard. Use
       the 1-5 keys to toggle the dice.

same-gnome: Bug fix: the number of selected stones is correctly
            reported when the cursor is over a blank region.


gnome-games "Credibility Problem" 2.5.0
========================================

So here it is, the first release of the new unstable series of
gnome-games and quite frankly I think I've done an excellent job of
trying to make it unstable.

There are of course numerous bug fixes, most of which are also in the
2.4.1 release. Updated translations too (athough I changed
several strings at the last minute). But these aren't the things
you're after, what you want is new features.

First some warnings. You will need the following software:
gettext 0.12 and intltool 0.27.2. 
GTK+ 2.3 (when it is released in a few days time) or GTK+ from CVS.

So, what is new ?

i18n: The .gmo files are no longer distributed in the tarball, you
have to generate them yourself.

installation: Building gnome-games outside the source tree should now
work.

gnotravex: Rather than using an "x" for a multiplication symbol we now
use real multiplication symbols.

aisleriot: The hint function for Odessa is now consistent with the
strategy suggested in the documentation. The win condition for spider
has been altered slightly: you now have to move the completed
sequences to the foundation.

mahjongg: Two thirds of this program has been rewritten. The game
generation code is quicker and doesn't generate occasional
warnings. The drawing code is now over five times faster and is
rescalable. Resizing the window is now supported. The tile sets are
now monolithic, you don't select foregrounds and backgrounds
separately anymore. Only the default tileset has been converted to the
new format so far. SVG is also supported and there is an example
tileset, but it is half-complete and unusable.

gnomine: There is now a hint function, an idea of Juhani Heino's. The
hint will clear one, hopefully useful, square at the cost of a ten
second penalty. The drawing code has been altered to make more use of
the gtk theme. This should improve the contrast between open and
closed cells even in pathological themes.

Thats about it, aside from Steven Chaplin's usual round of memory
leak fixes and one or two strange bugs which I *think* I've fixed.

gnome-games "Carisbrook" 2.3.7
==============================

This is a minor update over 2.3.6. The major difference is that there
is more checking of GConf return values. The only user visible changes
should be a new README file and translation updates.

There are still some bugs that it would be nice to have resolved by
2.4, if they can be reproduced. Aside from them, this is essentially
2.4.0.

gnome-games "It's For Your Own Good" 2.3.6
==========================================

This release is in theory a good facsimile of what 2.4.0 will look
like. The most obvious change will be that the documentation is now
mostly up-to-date. 

All games should now have state-sensitive undo and redo buttons as
well as full keyboard navigation for the preferences.

The bug count is now about a third of what it was at the start of the
2.3 series. Since there is no recent 2.2.x release of gnome-games this
can be considered a substitute, it compiles under the GNOME 2.2
environment without problems.

Changes by game:

Gataxx/Iagno
 - These games now share pixmaps. This saves about 700k.

Gtali:
  - Several dead options have been removed (or hidden as gconf keys).
  - Undo doesn't corrupt the display.

Gnotravex:
  - Resizing code now works a bit better.

Aisleriot:
 - If you play spider then there is a subtle change: to finish the
   game you have to move the completed piles up to the
   foundation. This is now consistent with other games.

Gnome-stones:
 - The joystick dialog actually works now, although since I don't have
   a joystick I have no idea if any of the joystick code actually works.

Gataxx:
 - The animation code actually does the right thing now. This is only
   noticeable if using "partial" animation.

Gnomine:
 - It compiles with gcc 2.96 again.
 - We now don't read all the pixmaps each time we recieve an expose
   event. Oops.

Gnobots:
 - Be a bit more graceful about failing to find configuration files.
 

gnome-games "Palm Cove" 2.3.5
=============================

This release is a little early since I'm going to be away during the
"official" release period. My location will of course be a closely
guarded secret.

There is but one major change, most of the names have changed ! This
hasn't been done to protect the innocent, or event the particularly
guilty. Instead it is an attempt to get rid of GNOME-this and
GNOME-that in the menus (as per the HIG). So "GNOME Robots" has become
"Robots" and "GTali" has become "Tali". This change only affects the menus.

The down side of this is that "glines" has become "Lines" and
"GNOME-Stones" has become "Stones". Anyone who has a better idea can
post suggestions under bug #117191 in Bugzilla.

Gnometris stays as Gnometris because it's really hard to avoid the
trade-marked "Tetris" and still be descriptive.

The other user-visible change is that the gnomine (sorry, "Mines")
window is now completely resizable and the size of the individual
tiles follows the size of the window (the numbers and icons scale
too). The explicit "mine size" item in the preferences dialog is
gone.

There were also some minor fixes, some of them very embarrassing to
the maintainer.

gnome-games "Cruising Along" 2.3.4
==================================

Things are cruising along towards a nice, stable, 2.4 release.
This release mostly contains bug fixes and clean-ups. 

A big thanks goes to Jon McCann and Steve Chaplin who have done most
of the work on this release.

The TODO file now has a complete list of what we hope to complete for
2.4 and an incomplete list of what is planned for 2.5 and beyond.

Be warned that changes involving gconf mean that some preferences will
be lost. Selecting the correct preferences again will fix this. We
apologise for the inconvenience, but the change-over from gnome-config
to gconf had already been delayed way too long for some games.

This is still an unstable release, but it should be more stable than
2.2 and testing is badly needed. In particular gnobots2 and mahjongg
have produced a number of crashes which aren't reproducible on the
maintainers machines. Stack traces or precise instructions on how to
reproduce them (including OS version, library versions, etc.) are
desparately needed to try and track these down.

All games have improved HIG compliance and most menus are now context
sensitive, e.g. you can't select undo if no move has been made.

AisleRiot:
 The help files work with yelp (even the broken versions).
 There should be better compatibility with Red Hat 9's guile.

Glines:
 The background is now a solid colour and the grid lines are thinner.

Gnome-stones:
 New opening title that should be i18n compatible now.

Gnotravex:
 The game is now resizable, try it, we hope to make most games like
 this in 2.5.


gnome-games "Shiny Things Revenge" 2.3.3
========================================

13% Fewer bugs, 15% less fat and 7% more games.

We now have a blackjack game courtesy of Jon McCann.

The package has also lost 1.5 Mb due to the judicious use of jpeg
compression.

For the paranoid system administrator there are now the
--disable-setgid, --with-scores-group and --with-scores-user options
for configure to help you manage those pesky setgid binaries.

The major changes, game by game:

aisleriot:
 * Should stop crashing if you have libguile >1.5.
 * More i18n work. Still not perfect, but should be a lot better.

gataxx:
 * The corruption when using the undo button has been fixed.
 * Don't crash after 128 turns.
 * Gataxx is now bug-free (TM).

gdk-card-image:
 * Some extra card images. Look for the "Dondorf" images.

gnome-stones:
 * There are now some sokoban levels to play. Thanks go to Alberto
   Manuel Brandao Simoes for convering the levels from Herman
   Mansilla's Yakoban game. Select the Gnomekoban levels from the
   preferences dialog and don't forget about the "restart level"
   option when you back youself into a corner.
 * There has been no real chance for play-testing these levels yet
   against the current sokoban implementation, if you have any
   suggestions to make feel free to file a report in bugzilla (even if
   it isn't technically a bug).

gnometris:
 * "Paused" and "Game over" messages.
 * Key behaviour fixes when a new piece appears.
 * Scoring consistency: dropping the blocks now scores as much as
   using fast-fall with the down arrow. 
 * Big PNG backgrounds converted to jpeg. The transition should happen
   automatically and not be noticeable.

mahjongg:
 * The multiple score dialogs problem might have been fixed this time.

Lots of fixes for behaviour and i18n all over the place, thanks should
especially go to Steve Chaplin and Christian Rose for their patience
in making sure I did things properly.

gnome-games "The Freecell Players Will Lynch Me" 2.3.2
======================================================

There have been some major changes with gnome-games. Gnobots2 and
Gnibbles are back, but Freecell has been removed. There are also 30%
fewer bugs than in 2.3.1.

Freecell addicts shouldn't panic: there is still a Freecell icon.
It links directly to the AisleRiot version of freecell. There are two
features that are known to be missing:
 1) There is no score dialog. If there is demand I will write a new
    one for AisleRiot.
 2) The translations will be marginally worse. AisleRiot has some 
    "interesting" issues regarding scheme and gettext. The fundamental 
    problem has been resolved, but none of the issues it caused have
    been fixed yet, this will happen in 2.3.3.
If any other favourite feature of freecell is missing, file a bug report.

The source for xbill and freecell are still available in the CVS
module gnome-games-deprecated. They are not currently buildable. Xbill
is also available (in a usable form) at www.xbill.org.

Here are the major changes:

aisleriot: 
        Gettext is now called from within scheme. There is no real
        change yet, but we should be able to improve the
        translations in the future.
        If --variation is used then it is only applied to that
        instance of the program.
 
gataxx: 
        It actually works now. At least we know the sanity checks
        work, pity the schema wasn't sane.

gdk-card-image: 
        The library has been moved to its own directory. Build
        problems on *BSD should now be resolved.

gnome-stones: 
        HIG cleanups.

gnomine:
        Improvements to the contrast between cleared and uncleared
        cells. The window doesn't resize when it looses focus.
        Also added checks to limit the number of mines to the field size.

gnotravex: 
        A tile corruption bug has been fixed. Gnotravex is now bug-free (TM).

gtali:  The binary is now 100k lighter thanks to careful use of
        colour-reduction.

libgames-support: 
        HIG and i18n fixups.

mahjongg:  
        HIG cleanups.

same-gnome: 
        Cleaner preferences dialog.

There has also been an effort to limit the number of dialog boxes
asking "Are you sure ...". This is an ongoing project.


gnome-games "Nothing to See Here" 2.3.1
=======================================

This is mostly bug fixes and not a lot of them. The primary purpose 
of this release is to make sure the new maintainer knows what he's doing.

* GTali behaves itself if you're winning by a gratuitous margin
* Improved GTali documentation.
* Moved the Gnotravex icon down to the shared directory.
* Fixed Same-Gnome sanity check so it actually stops the program crashing.
* Abel Cheung made sure all the ChangeLogs where in UTF-8 and not
  whatever we'd picked up along the way.

Corrupted GConf data is still likely to crash most games, but rampant
GConf misconfiguration should be handled gracefully. Bug reports to
the contrary are welcome.


gnome-games "Fat Camp" 2.3.0
====================

All of the gnome-games 2.2.1 changes:
* Fixed Freecell compile on FreeBSD
* Fixed GNect schemas
* Fixed GNOME Stones GObject usage
* Use Close instead of OK in Gnometris
* Cleaned up Mahjongg .desktop file
* Updated Mahjongg documentation

Plus:
* Removed games I either don't like, no-one uses, or are pointless
  (gnibbles, gnobots2, iagno2, xbill)
* Also removed the Curses port of gtali
* New Undo architecture in Aisleriot (PLEASE TEST) (closes #83517)
* Changed the next-move algorithm in Iagno (PLEASE TEST) (closes #101996)
* Mahjongg UI love -- now has CFM dialogs
* Aisleriot UI love -- the huge New Game menu has gone, useless table
  headers removed, dialogs are layered correctly, etc
* Added some spacing in the Freecell UI. Should make things clearer
* Added a GConf utility library, which gives us lots of sanity checks
  to tell people they can't install programs correctly
* Cool new icons in GNOME Mines from Jimmac


gnome-games "Cake or Death?" 2.2.0
==================================

* Fix "Figure figure" in GNOME Mines documentation
* Rename xBill icon to avoid conflicting with the original xBill
* All games actually have the same version now
* Lots of small memory leaks fixed
* Translations!

Thanks to the Documentation Team, the Translation Team, the Release
Team. Also to my parents, my girlfriend, my fish -- Sid, Griswold,
Tallulah, and departed Wanda. I love you guys! Thanks to Eddie and
Hactar for being good workstations, without you I'd have had to do
this with an abacus or something. Thanks to my neighbour, Dorothy, for
keeping me happy for days with a picture of when she met the Pope; and
Michele Campeotto for the same with a certain picture. Thanks to the
many people who submitted bug reports and patches, you all know who
you are.
