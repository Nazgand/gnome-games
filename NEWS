gnome-games "The Freecell Players Will Lynch Me" 2.3.2

There have been some major changes with gnome-games. Gnobots2 and
Gnibbles are back, but Freecell has been removed. There are also 30%
fewer bugs than in 2.3.1.

Freecell addicts shouldn't panic: there is still a Freecell icon.
It links directly to the AisleRiot version of freecell. There are two
features that are known to be missing:
 1) There is no score dialog. If there is demand I will write a new
    one for AisleRiot.
 2) The translations will be marginally worse. AisleRiot has some 
    "interesting" issues regarding scheme and gettext. The fundamental 
    problem has been resolved, but none of the issues it caused have
    been fixed yet, this will happen in 2.3.3.
If any other favourite feature of freecell is missing, file a bug report.

The source for xbill and freecell are still available in the CVS
module gnome-games-deprecated. They are not currently buildable. Xbill
is also available (in a usable form) at www.xbill.org.

Here are the major changes:

aisleriot: 
        Gettext is now called from within scheme. There is no real
        change yet, but we should be able to improve the
        translations in the future.
        If --variation is used then it is only applied to that
        instance of the program.
 
gataxx: 
        It actually works now. At least we know the sanity checks
        work, pity the schema wasn't sane.

gdk-card-image: 
        The library has been moved to its own directory. Build
        problems on *BSD should now be resolved.

gnome-stones: 
        HIG cleanups.

gnomine:
        Improvements to the contrast between cleared and uncleared
        cells. The window doesn't resize when it looses focus.
        Also added checks to limit the number of mines to the field size.

gnotravex: 
        A tile corruption bug has been fixed. Gnotravex is now bug-free (TM).

gtali:  The binary is now 100k lighter thanks to careful use of
        colour-reduction.

libgames-support: 
        HIG and i18n fixups.

mahjongg:  
        HIG cleanups.

same-gnome: 
        Cleaner preferences dialog.

There has also been an effort to limit the number of dialog boxes
asking "Are you sure ...". This is an ongoing project.


gnome-games "Nothing to See Here" 2.3.1
=======================================

This is mostly bug fixes and not a lot of them. The primary purpose 
of this release is to make sure the new maintainer knows what he's doing.

* GTali behaves itself if you're winning by a gratuitous margin
* Improved GTali documentation.
* Moved the Gnotravex icon down to the shared directory.
* Fixed Same-Gnome sanity check so it actually stops the program crashing.
* Abel Cheung made sure all the ChangeLogs where in UTF-8 and not
  whatever we'd picked up along the way.

Corrupted GConf data is still likely to crash most games, but rampant
GConf misconfiguration should be handled gracefully. Bug reports to
the contrary are welcome.


gnome-games "Fat Camp" 2.3.0
====================

All of the gnome-games 2.2.1 changes:
* Fixed Freecell compile on FreeBSD
* Fixed GNect schemas
* Fixed GNOME Stones GObject usage
* Use Close instead of OK in Gnometris
* Cleaned up Mahjongg .desktop file
* Updated Mahjongg documentation

Plus:
* Removed games I either don't like, no-one uses, or are pointless
  (gnibbles, gnobots2, iagno2, xbill)
* Also removed the Curses port of gtali
* New Undo architecture in Aisleriot (PLEASE TEST) (closes #83517)
* Changed the next-move algorithm in Iagno (PLEASE TEST) (closes #101996)
* Mahjongg UI love -- now has CFM dialogs
* Aisleriot UI love -- the huge New Game menu has gone, useless table
  headers removed, dialogs are layered correctly, etc
* Added some spacing in the Freecell UI. Should make things clearer
* Added a GConf utility library, which gives us lots of sanity checks
  to tell people they can't install programs correctly
* Cool new icons in GNOME Mines from Jimmac


gnome-games "Cake or Death?" 2.2.0
==================================

* Fix "Figure figure" in GNOME Mines documentation
* Rename xBill icon to avoid conflicting with the original xBill
* All games actually have the same version now
* Lots of small memory leaks fixed
* Translations!

Team. Also to my parents, my girlfriend, my fish -- Sid, Griswold,
Tallulah, and departed Wanda. I love you guys! Thanks to Eddie and
Hactar for being good workstations, without you I'd have had to do
this with an abacus or something. Thanks to my neighbour, Dorothy, for
keeping me happy for days with a picture of when she met the Pope; and

many people who submitted bug reports and patches, you all know who
