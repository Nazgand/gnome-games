gnome-games "Breakage is fun, it builds character" 2.1.0

* Lots of minor bug fixes (esp. to Aisleriot, Telsa)
* Love given to the UI
* A serious lack of translations, as they are all on the GNOME 2.0 branch.
  This is totally my fault as I have not told the translation team...
* (Probably) lots of new and interesting bugs


gnome-games "Rising Sun" 2.0.4

* Improved dialogs, which actually do what they say on the tin.
* High Scores are now only displayed when there are high scores to be
  displayed.

Thanks to Andrew Sobala and Samuel Stringham, amongst others, for
providing so many patches to gnome-games.


gnome-games "Clever Cow" 2.0.3

* General: Updated all .desktop files to comply with the HIG
* General: Build fixes for OSF/1 and Solaris

  close now, and appear in the correct location.

  and redraw the tiles correctly

* Gnibbles: default map size is medium
