For details about compiling the latest CVS version of gnome-games, see:

http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-games/contributing.html

People without access to GNOME CVS should post any patches (for both
bug fixes and enhancements) to GNOME Bugzilla at:

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

Suggestions for features can either be posted to games-list@gnome.org
or added as a bug-report in bugzilla. It is more likely to be
discussed if you submit it to the mailing list, it is also more likely
to be forgotten.

If you are looking for any mini-projects then there are a number that
can probably be done in gnome-games. Email the maintainer
(<callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>) for some up-to-date suggestions if you
are interested.

Those people with CVS access should feel free to commit bug fixes,
minor changes and of course translations. If you have any major
changes then it would be preferable to at least post a warning on the
mailing list. Keep in mind both the size of the package and impending
release dates.

Do NOT add new graphics or new games without consultation. The package
is big enough as it stands.
