STOP!

If it's a bug fix, make sure it goes into the gnome-games-1-0 branch (and if
applicable into head, although it'll get merged).  If it's a new game, put it in
head, not the stable branch.  If it's some weird new experimental rewrite, don't
put it in stable.  Don't ignore the stable branch like last time; I don't want
another 1.0.40 -> 1.0.41 fiasco.
