1. Introduction</H2>
Gnome Robots is a version of the text based robots game which can be found
on a number of UNIX systems, and comes with the BSD games package on Linux
systems.
<BR>This version allows you to select a number of animated graphics scenarios,
as well as providing a safe teleport feature so you are not totally at
the mercy of your computer's random number generator.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
2. Playing</H2>
When you start the game you will find yourself surrounded by a number of
robots, or some other strange but equally hostile adversaries if you have
chosen a scenario other than the default.
<BR>As you move about, using the keys listed below, the robots will move
directly towards you with one goal in mind - killing you.
<BR>Luckily you have two ways to avoid this unfortunate outcome.

<P>Firstly, the robots have not been blessed with a great deal of intelligence,
and will be destroyed if they crash into each other, or any other debris
which has been left around from previous collisions.
<BR>Secondly, if you do find yourself in a tight spot, you have the ability
to teleport randomly to another spot on the screen.

<P>Unfortunately, randomly teleporting means that there is a chance that
you might end up being right next to a robot so they can kill you when
they make their move. All is not lost however, as you can have a number of
safe teleports which will place you out of immediate danger. You can earn
more free teleports as you go along, getting one for each robot that is
destroyed while you are 'waiting', up to a maximum of 10. If you don't
want to waste your saved up safe teleports you can choose to randomly
teleport if you think it's safe enough.<BR>
You can switch the safe teleport option off to make the game behave
like the classic robots.

<P>If you press the 'Wait' key (see below) you will no longer be able to
move until either all of the robots, which still move towards you, are
gone or you are killed. Doing this will earn you extra safe teleports
as described above.

<H2>
3. Keys</H2>
There are three sets of keys for controlling your player -
<H3>
Standard</H3>
These are the standard keys for playing robots, with the exception that
'Enter' is now the key to wait for the end of the game, as 'W' is now used
by one of the other keyboard layouts.
<BR>

<pre>
  Up Left: Y           Up: K              Up Right: U
     Left: H  Stand Still: . or Space        Right: L
Down Left: B         Down: J            Down Right: N

         Teleport: T
Randomly Teleport: R
             Wait: Enter
</pre>

<H3>
Main Keyboard</H3>
These keys are laid out on the main part of the keyboard in star shaped
pattern for people who don't like the HJKL layout.
<BR>

<pre>
  Up Left: Q           Up: W    Up Right: E
     Left: A  Stand Still: S       Right: D
Down Left: Z         Down: X  Down Right: C

         Teleport: T
Randomly Teleport: R
             Wait: Enter
</pre>

<H3>
Numeric Keypad</H3>
These should work regardless of the Num Lock state
<BR>

<pre>
  Up Left: 7           Up: 8    Up Right: 9
     Left: 4  Stand Still: 5       Right: 6
Down Left: 1         Down: 2  Down Right: 3

         Teleport: +
Randomly Teleport: -
             Wait: Enter
</pre>

<H2>
4. Properties</H2>
The properties dialog allows you modify the behaviour and appearance of
the game.

<P>You can select which game graphics you want to use from those available
in the drop-down list box.
<BR>This selection will remain in effect until the next time you start
the game unless you select the 'make default' check-box.

<P>If the game is in safe mode and you try to make a move which would cause
you to be killed you are prevented from doing so. This only takes effect
if there is another safe move which you could have made, otherwise you
are allowed to proceed to your death.
<BR>If you don't select safe mode, then you don't get any protection at
all.

<P>If the save teleports option is selected then you can earn safe teleports
as you play they game. These will allow you to teleport without the risk of
appearing right next to a robot.

<P>The sound option allows you to switch off the beep when you get killed
or make a invalid move.

<H2>
5. Misc</H2>
You can design your own graphics for the game if you want. The graphics
files are found in
<BR>$PREFIX/share/pixmaps/gnobots, where $PREFIX depends on where Gnome
was installed, usually either '/usr' or '/usr/local'
<BR>Each character is 16x16 pixels and there are 10 of them arranged in
a PNG file which is 160x16 pixels in size. You can look at the existing
files to see the order in which they must be arranged to produce the correct
animated sequences.
<BR>Any graphics files which are placed in the directory are auto-detected
so you don't need to alter any configuration files.

<P>If you have any suggestions or discover any BUGS you can e-mail the
