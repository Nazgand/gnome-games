General 2.4 cleanups:

1. Documentation cleanup: version numbers, completeness and make sure
   they actually work.
2. GConf, make sure it is sane, works and accepts bad input gracefully.
3. HIG compliant preferences
4. Menu item sensitivity, undo, redo, hint, solve, etc.
5. Remove the quit dialog.
6. Builds without warnings (make sure they are enabled).

Y = OK., N = probably needs work, P = partial, ? = maybe, 
lower case letter = note. - = not applicable

These should all become yes or have a good reason why not.

                1.      2.      3.      4.      5.      6.

a) The preference and select dialogs are compliant, but there is
   debate about whether it is good UI. For the moment this counts as 
   a "good reason" since it really isn't high priority compared with 
   every other 2.4 issue.
e) Doesn't have any preferences, but if we start remembering which
   games have been done we will.
f) It turns out gnometris doesn't actually have any documentation.

2.4 Issues

General:
	- Update README and HACKING at the last minute to reflect
	  reality. Also make a big all-of-2.3 NEWS entry for 2.4.0.

AisleRiot:
        - Odessa hint function (bug 51694)

Blackjack:

Gataxx:
        - Share graphics with Iagno.

Glines:
        
Gnect:

Gnibbles:
        
Gnobots2:
        - Fix no-moves issue (bug 107846).

Gnome-stones:
        - Check joystick support actually works ?

Gnometris:
        - Have another go at tracking down bug 103787.

Gnomine:
        - Check flag counting code and whether this is in fact bug
          103125 is still possible.        

Gnotravex:

Gnotski:

Gtali:

Iagno:
        - Share graphics with gataxx.

Mahjongg:
        - Oddball crashes (bugs 82402, 100492, 102474, 116226).

Same-gnome:
        - Make the pixmap background transparent so that we don't have
          the rotate theme background problems (not urgent).

2.5 Issues

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Remove the need for setgid binaries (needs a setgid launcher
          and back-end modifications to libgnome).
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes. 
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable
        - Make the build system cleaner.

AisleRiot:
        - Scalability of cards (bugs 80167, 104969, 105536) 
        - Better card selection, include a preview (bug 110729)
        - Better klondike hint (bug 85712)
        - 3-card flip-over (possibly reinstate the game-specific
          options, bug 50704).
        - 2-suit spider (3-suit too ? bug 69252)
        - Scheme clean-ups (see bug 51016 for suggestions)
        - Be able to automatically drag lists of cards to the
          foundation and have them distributed (like at the end of
          klondike) this is less surprising than auto-move (bug 2845).
        - Pretty show at the end (bug 2845)
        - Be better at capturing cards (bug 91595)
        - Descriptions of games in Select dialog (bug 110730)
        - Can we eliminate the splash screen (bug 110731)
        - Find out what's wrong with block-ten.

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).

Gataxx:
        - Grid options in prefs (like iagno, see also the next item)
        - Share a front-end with Iagno.
        - AI improvement.

Glines:
        - Configure the playing field size and ball number (bug
          83532).
        - Scalability.
        - Remove the ball theme, perhaps, maybe.

Gnect:
        - Graphics (could we share some with iagno/gataxx)
        - Size of AI file
        - Sound improvements

Gnibbles:
        - Redo the graphics. Vector based and themable.

Gnobots2:
        - Graphics so they are viewable on large monitors.
        - Clean up the sounds.
        - Since we can't change some settings mid-game an end-game option
          would be good (also for bug 107846).
        - Keep the preferences dialog open and start a new game. Oops. 
          Also hiding things is not HIG compliant.

Gnome-stones:
        - Definitely redo locations of score and the like.
        - Fix "jerkiness", make the game "feel" better.
        - Separate the two games to be started separately (using the
          same shared code).
        - Fall back to any available game rather than giving up after 
          the chosen and default games have failed to load ?

Gnometris:
        - Update xtris backgrounds to give the current name (perhaps
          replace the x with a foot). 
        - Make the pieces scalable.
        - Drag and drop background.
        - Sound (see bug 80665, but we can't use those sounds) ?               
        - Write some documentation.

Gnomine:
        - Try and fix the colour issue (part of 112571, the bit where
          I misunderstand).
        - Consider bug 97833, but probably not.

Gnotravex:
        - Have a colour mode in addition to the numbers.
        - Replace x with a proper cross, if we can figure out the 
          gettext issues. 

Gnotski:
        - Redo the game so that it records what have been completed
          and also has a next game option (as well as a retry game
          option). See bug 111543.
        
Gtali:
        - AI upgrade, but make it optional: see Phil Woodward. "Yahtzee®: 
          The Solution", Chance 16(1):17-20 (Winter 2003). (bug 52635)
        - Anti-alias the dice (maybe remove the built-in xpms).

Iagno:
        - Merge with Gataxx (see above)
        - High contrast theme ? Other a11y stuff.
        - See if the code causeing problems in bug 79180 can't be 
          glib-ised to make the portability problem glibs.
        - Make defaults consistent with gataxx.

Mahjongg:
        - Consider the usability bugs (83531 and 84837), the first can
          be solved via scalable tiles the second via cleaner themes
          (it can also be worked into a high-contrast things to).
        - Fix shuffling bugs (91098, 94750).
        - Finish off the "creeping horror" code, try reversing the process, 
          build outside in.
        
Same-gnome:
        - Add a seed (bug 86088) ?
        - Continue arguing bug 91778.

libgames-support:
        - Document

gdk-card-image:
