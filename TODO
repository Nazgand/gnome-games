Priorities :

  iagno (to match gataxx)
  gnobots2, especially drawing code and mouse use
  rework aisleriot statistics code (cleanliness).
  New scoring infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 2.10:

  - Pango will support pixel font size specification (bug 119081), remove 
    workarounds found in Tetravex, Stones, Gnometris, and Blackjack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes (bug 80204).
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (bug 126284).
        - Look at network multi-player.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable
        - Make session management work.
        - Redo the scoring code (example front-end done).
        - Make the build system cleaner.
        - Naming issues: "Stones" (bug 117191)

AisleRiot:
	- Freecell hint threading (bug 134798)
        - Better klondike hint (bug 85712)
        - 3-card flip-over (possibly reinstate the game-specific
          options, bug 50704).
        - Scheme clean-ups (see bug 51016 for suggestions)
        - Be able to automatically drag lists of cards to the
          foundation and have them distributed (like at the end of
          klondike) this is less surprising than auto-move (bug 2845).
        - Be better at capturing cards (bug 91595)
        - Descriptions of games in Select dialog (bug 110730)
        - Find out what's wrong with block-ten.
        - Final missing features from stand-alone freecell (bug 124522).
        - Find the root cause of bug 121762.
	- Merge card.c into draw.c.

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).
        - Multiplayer (bug 129639)
        - Training mode (bug 129638)
        - Rules dialog clean-up (bug 124613)

Gataxx:
        - Grid option : There should b a gconf key (and schema).
        - Share a front-end with Iagno.
	- Fix the drawing issues with the grid hilight.

Gnect:
        - Graphics (could we share some with iagno/gataxx)
        - Size of AI file
        - Sound improvements
        - Save the window size with gconf.
	- Rewrite the size saving code and don't leak the gconfclient.

Gnibbles:
	- Have another look at the preferences: some are disabled during
	  game play, others are enabled, but restart the game. Be consistent.
	- AI worms.

Gnobots2:
        - Fix no-moves issue (bug 107846).
        - Graphics so they are viewable on large monitors.
        - Clean up the sounds (bug 152107).
        - Since we can't change some settings mid-game an end-game option
          would be good (bug 107846).
        - Keep the preferences dialog open and start a new game. Oops. 
          Also hiding things is not HIG compliant.
	- Icon theme for custom icons ?
        - UI review (bug 132387).

Gnome-stones:
        - Repair joystick support (bug 152651).
        - Definitely redo locations of score and the like.
        - Fix "jerkiness", make the game "feel" better.
        - Separate the two games to be started separately (using the
          same shared code).
        - Fall back to any available game rather than giving up after 
          the chosen and default games have failed to load ?
	- Re-examine the semantics for which game to start with.
	- Separate desktop entry for sokoban.
	- Sounds (bug 152107).

Gnometris:
	- Rewrite drawing code. After that, back out bug 130654.
        - Have another go at tracking down slow blocks (bug 103787).
        - Make the pieces scalable.
        - Drag and drop backgrounds:
          - Use heuristic to select tiled/scaled.
	  - Accept images from eog/konqueror etc.
	  - Accepts colours/gradients.

Gnomine:
        - Figure out bug 119043. Was it solved with 103125 ? I don't think so.
        - Try and fix the colour issue (part of bug 112571, the bit where
          I misunderstand).
	- Make drawing more efficient, cache the blended pixbufs on
	  the server.
	- Fix up the hint_used signal so that all states get returned this 
	  way (or something else that doesn't look completely awful like the 
	  current system).

Gnotravex:
        - Have a colour mode in addition to the numbers.
	- Make the numbers translatable.

Gnotski:
        - Record completed puzzles (bug 111543)

Gtali:
        - AI upgrade, but make it optional: see Phil Woodward. "Yahtzee®: 
          The Solution", Chance 16(1):17-20 (Winter 2003). (bug 52635)
        - Remove that space from gtali.schemas.in once intltool has
          had a few more releases (and upgrade the required version to 0.31
          or whatever it becomes.
	- Select all/select none, almost like (bug 137104).

Iagno:
	- Add an "I'm thinking" message, especially for level 3 AI.
        - Merge with Gataxx (see above)
        - High contrast theme ? Other a11y stuff.
        - See if the code causeing problems in bug 79180 can't be 
          glib-ised to make the portability problem glibs.
        - Make defaults consistent with gataxx.
        - Make selecting side in a network game better (bug 119195).
        - Make moves more obvious (bug 118996)

Mahjongg:
        - Fix up the tile search function for speed.
        - Make resizing a bit snappier.
        - Level editor and external level files.

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
	- Make a shared library. Rename to libgnome-games
        - Document
	- Use a second thread for pre-generating card images (I think
          this was shaunm's idea so he could take advantage of works' dual 
	  opteron).
