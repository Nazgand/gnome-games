Things that really need to be done before code-freeze

Mahjongg single pile shuffle problem.
Threading support for freecell hint generation.
SVG card deck for aisleriot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priorities for 2.7/2.8:

  iagno (to match gataxx)
  gnobots2, especially drawing code and mouse use
  rework aisleriot statistics code (cleanliness).
  New scoring infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

All bugs.

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes. (80204)
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (126284)
        - Look at network multi-player.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable
        - Make session management work.
        - Redo the scoring code (example front-end done).
        - Make the build system cleaner.
        - Naming issues: "Stones" (117191)

AisleRiot:
        - Better klondike hint (bug 85712)
        - 3-card flip-over (possibly reinstate the game-specific
          options, bug 50704).
        - Scheme clean-ups (see bug 51016 for suggestions)
        - Be able to automatically drag lists of cards to the
          foundation and have them distributed (like at the end of
          klondike) this is less surprising than auto-move (bug 2845).
        - Pretty show at the end (bug 2845)
        - Be better at capturing cards (bug 91595)
        - Descriptions of games in Select dialog (bug 110730)
        - Find out what's wrong with block-ten.
        - Final missing features from stand-alone freecell (124522).
        - Find the root cause of 121762.
	- Merge card.c into draw.c.

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).
        - Multiplayer (129639)
        - Training mode (129638)
        - Rules dialog clean-up (124613)

Gataxx:
        - Grid option : There should b a gconf key (and schema).
        - Share a front-end with Iagno.
	- Fix the drawing issues with the grid hilight.

Glines:
        - Configure the playing field size and ball number (bug
          83532).
	- Add an "alignment" property to games_grid_frame so that we
          can do away with the alignment for the "next balls" pixmaps
          and also avoid the "shrinking balls" problem at small window
	  sizes.

Gnect:
        - Graphics (could we share some with iagno/gataxx)
        - Size of AI file
        - Sound improvements
        - Save the window size with gconf.
	- Rewrite the size saving code and don't leak the gconfclient.

Gnibbles:
	- Have another look at the preferences: some are disabled during
	  game play, others are enabled, but restart the game. Be consistent.
	- AI worms.

Gnobots2:
        - Fix no-moves issue (bug 107846).
        - Graphics so they are viewable on large monitors.
        - Clean up the sounds (152107).
        - Since we can't change some settings mid-game an end-game option
          would be good (also for bug 107846).
        - Keep the preferences dialog open and start a new game. Oops. 
          Also hiding things is not HIG compliant.
	- Icon theme for custom icons ?
        - UI review (132387).

Gnome-stones:
        - Repair joystick support (152651).
        - Definitely redo locations of score and the like.
        - Fix "jerkiness", make the game "feel" better.
        - Separate the two games to be started separately (using the
          same shared code).
        - Fall back to any available game rather than giving up after 
          the chosen and default games have failed to load ?
	- Re-examine the semantics for which game to start with.
	- Separate desktop entry for sokoban.
	- Sounds (152107).

Gnometris:
	- Rewrite drawing code. After that, back out 130654.
        - Have another go at tracking down bug 103787.
        - Make the pieces scalable.
        - Drag and drop backgrounds:
          - Use heuristic to select tiled/scaled.
	  - Accept images from eog/konqueror etc.
	  - Accepts colours/gradients.
        - Revisit slow block bugs ? (103787)

Gnomine:
        - Figure out bug 119043. Was it solved with 103125 ? I don't think so.
        - Try and fix the colour issue (part of 112571, the bit where
          I misunderstand).
	- Make drawing more efficient, cache the blended pixbufs on
	  the server.
	- Fix up the hint_used signal so that all states get returned this 
	  way (or something else that doesn't look completely awful like the 
	  current system).
	- Check for SVG support at runtime.

Gnotravex:
        - Have a colour mode in addition to the numbers.
	- Make the numbers translatable.

Gnotski:
        - Record completed puzzles (111543)

Gtali:
        - AI upgrade, but make it optional: see Phil Woodward. "Yahtzee®: 
          The Solution", Chance 16(1):17-20 (Winter 2003). (bug 52635)
        - Remove that space from gtali.schemas.in once intltool has
          had a few more releases (and upgrade the required version to 0.31
          or whatever it becomes.
	- Select all/select none, almost like bug #137104.

Iagno:
	- Add an "I'm thinking" message, especially for level 3 AI.
        - Merge with Gataxx (see above)
        - High contrast theme ? Other a11y stuff.
        - See if the code causeing problems in bug 79180 can't be 
          glib-ised to make the portability problem glibs.
        - Make defaults consistent with gataxx.
        - Make selecting side in a network game better (119195).
        - Make moves more obvious (118996)

Mahjongg:
        - Finish off scaling support.
          - Fix up the tile search function for speed.
          - Make resizing a bit snappier (check the graphics scaling code, I
            think this is the bottleneck).
        - Level editor and external level files.
        
Same-gnome:
        - Make the pixmap background transparent so that we don't have
          the rotate theme background problems (not urgent). We should 
          also let the background be set (or steal it from an outer pixel
          of the pixmap).

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
	- Make a shared library. Rename to libgnome-games
        - Document
	- Use a second thread for pre-generating card images (I think
          this was shaunm's idea so he could take advantage of works' dual 
	  opteron).
