--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priorities for 2.7/2.8:

  iagno (to match gataxx)
  gnobots2, especially drawing code and mouse use
  rework aisleriot statistics code (cleanliness).
  New scoring infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

All bugs.

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes. 
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (126284)
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable
        - Make session management work.
        - Redo the scoring code.
        - Make the build system cleaner.
        - Naming issues (117191)

AisleRiot:
        - Better klondike hint (bug 85712)
        - 3-card flip-over (possibly reinstate the game-specific
          options, bug 50704).
        - 2-suit spider (3-suit too ? bug 69252)
        - Scheme clean-ups (see bug 51016 for suggestions)
        - Be able to automatically drag lists of cards to the
          foundation and have them distributed (like at the end of
          klondike) this is less surprising than auto-move (bug 2845).
        - Pretty show at the end (bug 2845)
        - Be better at capturing cards (bug 91595)
        - Descriptions of games in Select dialog (bug 110730)
        - Speed up the loading of card images.
        - Find out what's wrong with block-ten.
        - Final missing features from stand-alone freecell (124522).
        - Click moves instead of drag moves (123329)
        - Find the root cause of 121726.

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).
        - Multiplayer (129639)
        - Training mode (129638)
        - Resetting the balance (124629)
        - Rules dialog clean-up (124613)

Gataxx:
        - Grid options in prefs (like iagno, see also the next item)
        - Share a front-end with Iagno.

Glines:
        - Configure the playing field size and ball number (bug
          83532).
	- Add an "alignment" property to games_grid_frame so that we
          can do away with the alignment for the "next balls" pixmaps
          and also avoid the "shrinking balls" problem at small window
	  sizes.

Gnect:
        - Graphics (could we share some with iagno/gataxx)
        - Size of AI file
        - Sound improvements

Gnibbles:
        - Redo the graphics. Vector based and themable.
	- Have another look at the preferences: some are disabled during
	  game play, others are enabled, but restart the game. Be consistent.

Gnobots2:
        - Fix no-moves issue (bug 107846).
        - Graphics so they are viewable on large monitors.
        - Clean up the sounds.
        - Since we can't change some settings mid-game an end-game option
          would be good (also for bug 107846).
        - Keep the preferences dialog open and start a new game. Oops. 
          Also hiding things is not HIG compliant.
	- Restore the es, it and da help docs translation. Convert html->xml.
        - Make game playable with a mouse.
        - UI review (132387).

Gnome-stones:
        - Check joystick support actually works ?
        - Definitely redo locations of score and the like.
        - Fix "jerkiness", make the game "feel" better.
        - Separate the two games to be started separately (using the
          same shared code).
        - Fall back to any available game rather than giving up after 
          the chosen and default games have failed to load ?
	- Re-examine the semantics for which game to start with.
	- Separate desktop entry for sokoban.

Gnometris:
        - Have another go at tracking down bug 103787.
        - Update xtris backgrounds to give the current name (perhaps
          replace the x with a foot). 
        - Make the pieces scalable.
        - Drag and drop background.
        - Sound (see bug 80665 <- new sounds) ?               
	- Back out bug 130654 when the drawing code is rewritten (and
	  also make the preferences universally enabled).
        - Revisit slow block bugs ? (103787)

Gnomine:
        - Figure out bug 119043. Was it solved with 103125 ? I don't think so.
        - Try and fix the colour issue (part of 112571, the bit where
          I misunderstand).
        - Make the hint item insensitive when we're in the "hide"
          mode and when the game is over and before a new game.
	- Make drawing more efficient, cache the blended pixbufs on
	  the server.
	- Make the cross-out for bad guesses in a failed game better (i.e.
          heavier when the window is large).
        - Rendering improvements as per 132423.
        - Better access to other scores (128235)
        - Session-management related segfault (120461)
        - Other misc crasher (120459) ?
	- Fix up the hint_used signal so that all states get returned this 
	  way (or something else that doesn't look completely awful like the 
	  current system).
	- Add credits for the tile icons to the about box once strings have 
	  thawed again.
	- Check for SVG support at runtime.

Gnotravex:
        - Have a colour mode in addition to the numbers.
	- Make the numbers translatable.

Gnotski:
        - Redo the game so that it records what have been completed
          and also has a next game option (as well as a retry game
          option). See bug 111543.
        
Gtali:
        - AI upgrade, but make it optional: see Phil Woodward. "Yahtzee®: 
          The Solution", Chance 16(1):17-20 (Winter 2003). (bug 52635)
        - Anti-alias the dice (maybe remove the built-in xpms).
	- Restore the Danish help docs translation.
        - Remove that space from gtali.schemas.in once intltool has
          had a few more releases (and upgrade the required version to 0.31
          or whatever it becomes.

Iagno:
	- Add an "I'm thinking" message, especially for level 3 AI.
        - Merge with Gataxx (see above)
        - High contrast theme ? Other a11y stuff.
        - See if the code causeing problems in bug 79180 can't be 
          glib-ised to make the portability problem glibs.
        - Make defaults consistent with gataxx.
        - Possibly fixed crasher (123351).
        - Make selecting side in a network game better (119195).
        - Make moves more obvious (118996)
        - Undo has problems in a network game (118995)

Mahjongg:
        - Finish off scaling support.
          - Rebuild seta.png
          - Fix up the tile search function for speed.
          - Make resizing a bit snappier (check the graphics scaling code, I
            think this is the bottleneck).
        - Level editor and external level files.
        - Oddball crashes (bugs 82402, 100492, 102474, 116226).
	- Consider different options other than "OK" to go along with the 
	  "shuffle" option in the "no more moves dialog".
	- Create a new category in the about box for layout contributors 
	  (i.e. Rexford and Kryzsztof) once strings thaw.
        
Same-gnome:
        - Add a seed (bug 86088) ?
        - Continue arguing bug 91778.
        - Make the pixmap background transparent so that we don't have
          the rotate theme background problems (not urgent). We should 
          also let the background be set (or steal it from an outer pixel
          of the pixmap).

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
	- Make a shared library. Rename to libgnome-games
        - Document

gdk-card-image:
	- Pretty much deprectaed, see what Jon wants to do.
	- Finish off the replacement in libgames.
	- When a "custom" style is used make sure that there is no selection.
 	  Currently the default is selected, this may be a limit in the GtkTreeView
	  widget.
