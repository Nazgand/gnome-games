General 2.4 cleanups:

1. Documentation cleanup: version numbers, completeness and make sure
   they actually work.
2. GConf, make sure it is sane, works and accepts bad input gracefully.
3. HIG compliant preferences
4. Menu item sensitivity, undo, redo, hint, solve, etc.
5. Remove the quit dialog.
6. Builds without warnings (make sure they are enabled).

Y = OK., N = probably needs work, P = partial, ? = maybe, 
lower case letter = note. - = not applicable

These should all become yes or have a good reason why not.

                1.      2.      3.      4.      5.      6.

a) The preference and select dialogs are compliant, but there is
   debate about whether it is good UI.
b) Some checks are made, but, for example you can have 100 worms.
c) Yes, except for some horrible behaviour with the control selection.
d) Yes, but check that the screenshots where done with the correct
   theme.
e) Doesn't have any preferences, but if we start remembering which
   games have been done we will.
f) Not auto-apply.
g) Yes, but it is too high for a 480 pixel high screen.

2.4 Issues

General:
        - Make sure the build system is clean.

AisleRiot:
        - Consider spider game-over too soon (bug 101984)
        - Odessa hint function (bug 51694)
        - Corner pixels in the mask.

Blackjack:
        - Whatever the UI review says.

Gataxx:
        - Share graphics with Iagno.
        - Grid visibility issues.
        - Grid options in prefs (once previous is sorted).
        - Start-up grid behaviour is odd.

Glines:
        - Remove the ball theme.
        - Clean up the classic theme.
        
Gnect:
        - Default controls -> arrow keys
        - The -> in the welcome message
        - Controls aren't a11y (bug 97327)

Gnibbles:
        
Gnobots2:
        - Find out why it crashes for some people (bugs 92297, 102370,
          112059, 113186, 113657).
        - Fix no-moves issue (bug 107846).

Gnome-stones:
        - Fixup the horrible problems in the prefs dialog like the
          missing sound options.
        - Also the joystick tab.
        - Hide the filename columns.
        - Remove the help button.
        - Rearrange location of scores, etc., if it seems serious
          (must play it some more). Otherwise this can be left to 2.5.
        - Try and track down bug 106623, it may be because they have
          never selected a game (in which case it is a real bug) or it
          is misinstalled and there is nothing to load (in which case
          there should be an error dialog).

Gnometris:
        - Update xtris backgrounds to give the current name (perhaps
          replace the x with a foot). Not urgent and can wait until 2.5.
        - Have another go at tracking down bug 103787.
        - Check that there's nothing funny in the way we build C++
          programs (bug 92559) or alternatively confirm that there is
          a RedHat 7.2 package that could be missing.

Gnomine:
        - Resizable window (2.4 since everything is already in place).
        - Again, an unreproducable segfault (bugs 95231, 100932,
          114223).
        - Check flag counting code and whether this is in fact bug
          103125 is still possible.        

Gnotravex:
        - Tweak the tile positions within the game widget.

Gnotski:

Gtali:
        - Some of the options can be removed.
        - Anti-alias the dice if we have time (maybe remove the
          built-in xpms) this can safely be left to 2.5.
        - Stripe the lines if possible.

Iagno:
        - Share graphics with gataxx.
        - Make defaults consistent with gataxx.
        - Preferences aren't auto apply.
        - Make sure the grid is always visible.
        - Start-up grid behaviour is odd.

Mahjongg:
        - Oddball crashes (bugs 82402, 100492, 102474).
        - Move the seed to the title (or whatever is consistent).
        - Fix shuffling bugs (91098, 94750).
        - GConf key fixes (no '-' character), see if it can be made
          backwards compatible.
        - It takes too long to generate a new board (it seems to try randomly 
          until it finds a solvable one). This is intolerable when simply 
          building the game backwards does it trivially. Implement if time.
          Can also be used to fix the shuffling bugs.

Same-gnome:
        - Highlight the current theme in the prefs dialog.
        - Make the pixmap background transparent so that we don't have
          the rotate theme background problems (not urgent).

2.5 Issues

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Remove the need for setgid binaries (needs a setgid launcher
          and back-end modifications to libgnome).
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes. 
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.

AisleRiot:
        - Scalability of cards (bugs 80167, 104969, 105536) 
        - Better card selection, include a preview (bug 110729)
        - Better klondike hint (bug 85712)
        - 3-card flip-over (possibly reinstate the game-specific
          options, bug 50704).
        - 2-suit spider (3-suit too ? bug 69252)
        - Scheme clean-ups (see bug 51016 for suggestions)
        - Be able to automatically drag lists of cards to the
          foundation and have them distributed (like at the end of
          klondike) this is less surprising than auto-move (bug 2845).
        - Pretty show at the end (bug 2845)
        - Be better at capturing cards (bug 91595)
        - Descriptions of games in Select dialog (bug 110730)
        - Can we eliminate the splash screen (bug 110731)

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).

Gataxx:
        - Share a front-end with Iagno.
        - AI improvement.

Gline:
        - Configure the playing field size and ball number (bug
          83532).
        - Scalability.

Gnect:
        - Graphics (could we share some with iagno/gataxx)
        - Size of AI file
        - Sound improvements

Gnibbles:
        - Redo the graphics. Vector based and themable.

Gnobots2:
        - Graphics so they are viewable on large monitors.
        - Clean up the sounds.

Gnome-stones:
        - Definitely redo locations of score and the like.
        - Fix "jerkiness", make the game "feel" better.
        - Separate the two games to be started separately (using the
          same shared code).

Gnometris:
        - Make the pieces scalable.
        - Drag and drop background.
        - Sound (see bug 80665, but we can't use those sounds) ?               

Gnomine:
        - Try and fix the colour issue (part of 112571, the bit where
          I misunderstand).
        - Consider bug 97833, but probably not.

Gnotravex:
        - Have a colour mode in addition to the numbers.

Gnotski:
        - Redo the game so that it records what have been completed
          and also has a next game option (as well as a retry game
          option). See bug 111543.
        
Gtali:
        - AI upgrade, but make it optional: see Phil Woodward. "Yahtzee®: 
        The Solution", Chance 16(1):17-20 (Winter 2003). (bug 52635)

Iagno:
        - Merge with Gataxx (see above)
        - High contrast theme ? Other a11y stuff.
        - See if the code causeing problems in bug 79180 can't be 
          glib-ised to make the portability problem glibs.

Mahjongg:
        - Consider the usability bugs (83531 and 84837), the first can
          be solved via scalable tiles the second via cleaner themes
          (it can also be worked into a high-contrast things to).
        
Same-gnome:
        - Add a seed (bug 86088) ?
        - Continue arguing bug 91778.
