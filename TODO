Things to work on before GNOME Games 2.0:

General:

 * Help->game menu is not working on any game.
 * Wipe out all the clock.[ch] files around and use
   libgames-support/games-clock.
 * Port everything to GConf, it will be post 2.0 (or
   before if we have time to finish everything else).

Aisleriot:
 
 * Have some problems on the magic scrollmenu it's using,
   i need a pretty dialog to chose the game would be better.

Gnome Stones:

 * It does have some fonts problem.
 * The game feels like slow.

Gnometris:

 * Does not update the windows size when you changue
   the field size.

Xbill:

 * We may want to update to xbill 2.1 since it's rewriten in
   C and inclues a gtk interface already.

It's all i can get on a very quick test.
