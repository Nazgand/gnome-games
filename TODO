Things to work on before GNOME Games 2.0:

General:

 * Port everything to GConf, it will be post 2.0 (or
   before if we have time to finish everything else).
   Need porting:
   glines, gnobots2, aisleriot, gnibbles, gnome-stones

 * Needing Docs:
   freecell, gnometris, gnotski

Gnome Stones:

 * It does have some fonts problem.
 * The game feels like slow.

Gnometris:

 * Does not update the windows size when you changue
   the field size.


Games needing GConf sanity checks:
  freecell, gnomine, gtali
