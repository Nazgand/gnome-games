	* src/dialog.cpp: Added all rule fields to tree view in pref
	dialog so that rules should be mostly self documented.  Also
	removed unused functions and HIGified alerts.

	* src/game.h: 
	* src/game.cpp: Added new functions to load rules from file.
	Added new BJGameRules class derived from BJRules that holds
	all rule attributes.

	* src/strategy.cpp: Added get methods for private variables.

	* data/Vegas_Strip.rules: Change to allow double after split,
	surrender, and resplitting aces.  This should not affect the
	cached rules file.
