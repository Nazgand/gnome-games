	Use and check return value.
	(saveHandXML, savePlayerHandCountXML, saveCountXML) 
	(saveValueSplitXML, saveResplitXML, saveOverallValuesXML) 
	(saveOverallValueXML, savePlayerHandsXML, saveXML) 
	(load_array_from_string, parse_hand, parse_hands)

2003-12-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/hand.cpp (bj_hand_hit, bj_hand_double, bj_hand_finish_play): 
	* src/draw.cpp (bj_draw_set_dealer_text, bj_draw_set_player_text) 
	(bj_draw_paint_text, bj_draw_take_snapshot, bj_draw_refresh_screen):
	Use new approach for creating the text on the playing area.  Instead
	of having the hand and dealer methods called to update the text
	on screen for every screen update, have the hand and dealer set
	the markup text after every play and let the screen update render
	that when needed.  This allows the positioning of the pango layout
	to happen in draw.cpp.  And that allows positioning to scale with
	font size.

	* src/player.cpp (showProbabilities, showOptions):
	(showCount):
	Use monospace font family instead of fixed.  Use non-white color so
	that text will show up against white card if necessary.  Make
	headings bold.  Make best option bold.  Don't use a fixed font
	size.

	GNOME_GAMES_CFLAGS.
